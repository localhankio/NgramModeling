The American people are catching on  They understand that something is profoundly wrong when  in our country today  the top one-tenth of 1 percent own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent and when the 20 richest people own more wealth than the bottom 150 million Americans  half of our population  They know that the system is rigged when the average person is working longer hours for lower wages  while 58 percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent 
They also know that a handful of people on Wall Street have extraordinary power over the economic and political life of our country  As most people know  in the 1990s and later  the financial interests spent billions of dollars in lobbying and campaign contributions to force through Congress the deregulation of Wall Street  the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act and the weakening of consumer protection laws in states 
They spent this money in order to get the government off their backs and to show the American people what they could do with that new-won freedom  Well  they sure showed the American people  In 2008  the greed  recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street nearly destroyed the U S  and global economy 
Millions of Americans lost their jobs  their homes and their life savings 
While Wall Street received the largest taxpayer bailout in the history of the world with no strings attached  the American middle class continues to disappear  poverty is increasing and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing wider and wider  And Wall Street executives still receive huge compensation packages as if the financial crisis they created never happened 
Greed  fraud  dishonesty and arrogance  these are the words that best describe the reality of Wall Street today 
So  to those on Wall Street who may be listening today  let me be very clear  Greed is not good  In fact  the greed of Wall Street and corporate America is destroying the fabric of our nation  And  here is a New Years Resolution that I will keep if elected president  If you do not end your greed  we will end it for you 
We will no longer tolerate an economy and a political system that has been rigged by Wall Street to benefit the wealthiest Americans in this country at the expense of everyone else 
While President Obama deserves credit for improving this economy after the Wall Street crash  the reality is that a lot of unfinished business remains to be done 
Our goal must be to create a financial system and an economy that works for all Americans  not just a handful of billionaires
That means we have got to end  once and for all  the scheme that is nothing more than a free insurance policy for Wall Street  the policy of too big to fail 
We need a banking system that is part of the productive economy making loans at affordable rates to small- and medium-sized businesses so that we create decent-paying jobs  Wall Street cannot continue to be an island unto itself  gambling trillions in risky financial instruments  making huge profits and assured that  if their schemes fail  the taxpayers will be there to bail them out 
In 2008  the taxpayers of this country bailed out Wall Street because we were told they were too big to fail  Yet  today  3 out of the 4 largest financial institutions (JP Morgan Chase  Bank of America and Wells Fargo) are nearly 80 percent bigger than before we bailed them out  Incredibly  the six largest banks in this country issue more than two-thirds of all credit cards and more than 35 percent of all mortgages  They control more than 95 percent of all financial derivatives and hold more than 40 percent of all bank deposits  Their assets are equivalent to nearly 60 percent of our GDP  Enough is enough 
If a bank is too big to fail  it is too big to exist  When it comes to Wall Street reform that must be our bottom line  This is true not just from a risk perspective and the fear of another bailout  It is also true from the reality that a handful of huge financial institutions simply have too much economic and political power over this country 
If Teddy Roosevelt  the Republican trust-buster  were alive today  he would say break em up  And he would be right 
And  heres how I will accomplish that 
Within the first 100 days of my administration  I will require the secretary of the Treasury Department to establish a Too-Big-to Fail list of commercial banks  shadow banks and insurance companies whose failure would pose a catastrophic risk to the United States economy without a taxpayer bailout 
Within one year  my administration will break these institutions up so that they no longer pose a grave threat to the economy as authorized under Section 121 of the Dodd-Frank Act 
And  I will fight to reinstate a 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act to clearly separate commercial banking  investment banking and insurance services  Let's be clear  this legislation  introduced by my colleague Senator Elizabeth Warren  aims at the heart of the shadow banking system 
In my view  Senator Warren  is right  Dodd-Frank should have broken up Citigroup and other  too- big-to-fail banks into pieces  And that's exactly what we need to do  And that's what I commit to do as president 
Now  my opponent  Secretary Clinton says that Glass-Steagall would not have prevented the financial crisis because shadow banks like AIG and Lehman Brothers  not big commercial banks  were the real culprits 
Secretary Clinton is wrong 
Shadow banks did gamble recklessly  but where did that money come from  It came from the federally-insured bank deposits of big commercial banks  something that would have been banned under the Glass-Steagall Act 
Let's not forget  President Franklin Roosevelt signed this bill into law precisely to prevent Wall Street speculators from causing another Great Depression  And  it worked for more than five decades until Wall Street watered it down under President Reagan and killed it under President Clinton 
And  let's not kid ourselves  The Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department didn't just bail out shadow banks  As a result of an amendment that I offered to audit the emergency lending activities of the Federal Reserve during the financial crisis  we learned that the Fed provided more than $16 trillion in short-term  low-interest loans to every major financial institution in the country including Citigroup  JP Morgan Chase  Bank of America  Wells Fargo  not to mention large corporations  foreign banks  and foreign central banks throughout the world 
Secretary Clinton says we just need to impose a few more fees and regulations on the financial industry  I disagree 
As former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich has said and I quote   Giant Wall Street banks continue to threaten the wellbeing of millions of Americans  but what to do  Bernie Sanders says break them up and resurrect the Glass-Steagall Act that once separated investment from commercial banking  Hillary Clinton says charge them a bit more and oversee them more carefully  Hillary Clinton's proposals would only invite more dilution and finagle  The only way to contain the Street's excesses is with reforms so big  bold  and public they can't be watered down  busting up the biggest banks and resurrecting Glass-Steagall  Secretary Reich is right  Real Wall Street reform means breaking up the big banks and re-establishing firewalls that separates risk taking from traditional banking 
My opponent says that  as a senator  she told bankers to  cut it out and end their destructive behavior  But  in my view  establishment politicians are the ones who need to  cut it out  The reality is that Congress doesn't regulate Wall Street  Wall Street  its lobbyists and their billions of dollars regulate Congress  We must change that reality  and as president I will 
It is no secret that millions of Americans have become disillusioned with our political process  They don't vote  They don't believe much of what comes out of Washington  They don't think anyone is there representing their interests  In my view  one of the reasons for that deep disillusionment is the widespread understanding that our criminal justice system is broken and grossly unfair  and that we do not have equal justice under the law  The average American sees kids being arrested and sometimes even jailed for possessing marijuana or other minor crimes  But when it comes to Wall Street executives  some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in this country  whose illegal behavior caused pain and suffering for millions  somehow nothing happens to them  No police record  No jail time  No justice 
We live in a country today that has an economy that is rigged  a campaign finance system which is corrupt and a criminal justice system which  too often  does not dispense justice 
Not one major Wall Street executive has been prosecuted for causing the near collapse of our entire economy 
That will change under my administration   Equal Justice Under Law will not just be words engraved on the entrance of the Supreme Court  It will be the standard that applies to Wall Street and all Americans 
It seems like almost every few weeks we read about one giant financial institution after another being fined or reaching settlements for their reckless  unfair and deceptive activities 
Some people believe that this is an aberration  that we have an honest financial system in which  every now and then  major financial institutions do something wrong and get caught  In my view  the evidence suggests that would be an incorrect analysis 
The reality is that fraud is the business model on Wall Street  It is not the exception to the rule  It is the rule  And in a weak regulatory climate the likelihood is that Wall Street gets away with a lot more illegal behavior than we know of 
How many times have we heard the myth that what Wall Street did may have been wrong but it wasn't illegal 
Let me help shatter that myth today 
Since 2009  major financial institutions in this country have been fined $204 billion  $204 billion  And that takes place in a weak regulatory climate 
Here are just a few examples of when major banks were caught doing illegal activity 
In August 2014  Bank of America settled a case with the Department of Justice for more than $16 billion on charges that the bank misled investors about the riskiness of mortgage-backed securities it sold in the run-up to the crisis 
In November of 2013  JP Morgan settled a case for $13 billion with the Department of Justice and the Federal Housing Finance Agency over charges the bank knowingly sold securities made up of low-quality mortgages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 
In June of 2014  BNP Paribas was sentenced to five years probation and was ordered to pay $8 9 billion in penalties by a U S  District Judge in Manhattan after this bank pled guilty to charges of violating sanctions by conducting business in Sudan  Iran and Cuba 
Let me read you a few headlines and you tell me how it makes sense that not one executive was prosecuted for fraud 
CNN Headline  May 20  2015   5 big banks pay $5 4 billion for rigging currencies  Those banks include JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup 
Headline from the International Business Times (February 24  2015):  Big Banks Under Investigation For Allegedly Fixing Precious Metals Prices  The Banks under investigation included Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase 
Headline from The Real News Network (November 26  2013):  Documents in JPMorgan settlement reveal how every large bank in the U S  has committed mortgage fraud  Headline from The Washington Post (March 14  2014):  In lawsuit  FDIC accuses 16 big banks of fraud  conspiracy  which included Bank of America  Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase 
Headline from the Guardian (April 2  2011):  How a big U S  bank laundered billions from Mexico's murderous drug gangs  This article talks about how Wachovia (which was acquired by Wells Fargo) aided Mexican drug cartels in transferring billions of dollars in illegal drug money  Here is what the federal prosecutor (Jeffrey Sloman) said about this   Wachovia's blatant disregard for our banking laws gave international cocaine cartels a virtual carte blanche to finance their operations  Yet  the total fine for this offense was less than 2% of the bank's $12 3 billion profit for 2009 and no one went to jail  No one went to jail 
And  if that's not bad enough  here's another one 
Headline  The Wall Street Journal  February 9  2011   J P  Morgan Apologizes for Military Foreclosures  Here is a case where JP Morgan Chase  the largest bank in America  wrecked the finances of 4 000 military families in violation of the Civil Service Members Relief Act  yet no one went to jail 
And  when I say that the business model of Wall Street is fraud that is not just Bernie Sanders talking  That is what financial executives told the University of Notre Dame in a study on the ethics of the financial services industry last year 
According to this study  51 percent of Wall Street executives making more than $500 000 a year found it likely that their competitors have engaged in unethical or illegal activity in order to gain an edge in the market 
More than one-third of financial executives have either witnessed or have firsthand knowledge of wrongdoing in the workplace 
Nearly one in five financial service professionals believe they must engage in illegal or unethical activity to be successful 
Twenty-five percent of financial executives have signed or been asked to sign a confidentiality agreement that would prohibit reporting illegal or unethical activities to the authorities 
Here's what one banker from Barclays said in 2010  when he was caught trying to price-fix the $5 trillion-per-day currency market   If you ain't cheating  you ain't trying  Here's what an analyst from Standard & Poors said in 2008   Let's hope we are all wealthy and retired by the time this house of cards falters  This country can no longer afford to tolerate the culture of fraud and corruption on Wall Street 
Under my administration  Wall Street CEOs will no longer receive a get-out-of jail free card  Big banks will not be too big to fail  Big bankers will not be too big to jail 
As president  I will nominate and appoint people with a track record of standing up to power  rather than those who have made millions defending Wall Street CEOs  Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks will not be represented in my administration 
And  if we are serious about reforming our financial system  we have got to establish a tax on Wall Street speculators  We have got to discourage reckless gambling on Wall Street and encourage productive investments in the job-creating economy 
We will use the revenue from this tax to make public colleges and universities tuition free  During the financial crisis  the middle class of this country bailed out Wall Street  Now  it's Wall Street's turn to help the middle class 
We cannot have a safe and sound financial system if we cannot trust the credit agencies to accurately rate financial products  And  the only way we can restore that trust is to make sure credit rating agencies cannot make a profit from Wall Street 
Investors would not have bought the risky mortgage backed derivatives that led to the Great Recession if credit agencies did not give these worthless financial products triple-A ratings  ratings that they knew were bogus 
And  the reason these risky financial schemes were given such favorable ratings is simple  Wall Street paid for them 
Under my administration  we will turn for-profit credit rating agencies into non-profit institutions  independent from Wall Street  No longer will Wall Street be able to pick and choose which credit agency will rate their products 
If we are going to create a financial system that works for all Americans  we have got to stop financial institutions from ripping off the American people by charging sky-high interest rates and outrageous fees 
In my view  it is unacceptable that Americans are paying a $4 or $5 fee each time they go to the ATM 
It is unacceptable that millions of Americans are paying credit card interest rates of 20 or 30 percent 
The Bible has a term for this practice  It's called usury  And in The Divine Comedy  Dante reserved a special place in the Seventh Circle of Hell for those who charged people usurious interest rates 
Today  we don't need the hellfire and the pitch forks  we don't need the rivers of boiling blood  but we do need a national usury law 
Today  we need to cap interest rates on credit cards and consumer loans at 15 percent 
In 1980  Congress passed legislation to require credit unions to cap interest rates on their loans at no more than 15 percent  And  that law has worked well  Unlike big banks  credit unions did not receive a huge bailout from the taxpayers of this country  It is time to extend this cap to every lender in America 
We must also cap ATM fees at $2 00  People should not have to pay a 10 percent fee for withdrawing $40 of their own money out of an ATM 
Big banks need to stop acting like loan sharks and start acting like responsible lenders 
We also need to give Americans affordable banking options 
The reality is that  unbelievably  millions of low-income Americans live in communities where there are no normal banking services  Today  if you live in a low-income community and you need to cash a check or get a loan to pay for a car repair or a medical emergency  where do you go 
You go to a payday lender who could charge an interest rate of over 300 percent and trap you into a vicious cycle of debt  That is unacceptable 
We need to stop payday lenders from ripping off millions of Americans  Post offices exist in almost every community in our country  One important way to provide decent banking opportunities for low income communities is to allow the U S  postal Service to engage in basic banking services  and that's what I will fight for 
Further  we need to structurally reform the Federal Reserve to make it a more democratic institution responsive to the needs of ordinary Americans  not just the billionaires on Wall Street 
When Wall Street was on the verge of collapse  the Federal Reserve acted with a fierce sense of urgency to save the financial system  We need the Fed to act with the same boldness to combat unemployment and low wages 
Further  we need to structurally reform the Federal Reserve to make it a more democratic institution responsive to the needs of ordinary Americans  not just the billionaires on Wall Street 
In my view  it is unacceptable that the Federal Reserve has been hijacked by the very bankers it is in charge of regulating  I think the American people would be shocked to learn that Jamie Dimon  the CEO of JP Morgan Chase  served on the board of the New York Fed at the same time that his bank received a $391 billion bailout from the Federal Reserve  That is a clear conflict of interest that I would ban as president  When I am elected  the foxes will no longer be guarding the henhouse at the Fed  Under my administration  banking industry executives will no longer be allowed to serve on the Fed's boards and handpick its members and staff 
Further  the Fed should stop paying financial institutions interest to keep money out of the economy and parked at the Fed  Incredibly  the excess reserves of financial institutions that are sitting in the Federal Reserve has grown from less than $2 billion in 2008 to $2 4 trillion today  That is absurd 
Instead of paying banks interest on these reserves  the Fed should charge them a fee that could be used to provide affordable loans to small businesses to create hundreds of thousands of jobs 
Finally  let me tell you what no other candidate will tell you  No president  not Bernie Sanders or anyone else  can effectively address the economic crises facing the working families of this country alone  The truth is that Wall Street  corporate America  the corporate media and wealthy campaign donors are just too powerful 
What this campaign is about is building a political movement which revitalizes American democracy  which brings millions of people together  black and white  Latino  Asian-American  Native American  young and old  men and women  gay and straight  native born and immigrant  people of all religions 
Yes  Wall Street has enormous economic and political power  Yes  Wall Street makes huge campaign contributions  they have thousands of lobbyists and they provide very generous speaking fees to those who go before them 
Yes  They have an endless supply of money  But we have something they don't have  And that is that when millions of working families stand together  demanding fundamental changes in our financial system  we have the power to bring about that change 
Yes  we can make our economy work for all Americans  not just a handful of wealthy speculators  And  now more than ever  that is exactly what we must do 
And so my message to you today is straightforward  If elected president  I will rein in Wall Street so they can't crash our economy again 
Will they like me  No  Will they begin to play by the rules if I'm president  You better believe it 
Thank you and I look forward to working with the most powerful force in our great nation  not the Barons of Wall Street but the people our government was created to serve  
How great it is to be with you tonight 
Let me begin by thanking the hundreds of thousands of Americans who actively participated in our campaign as volunteers  Let me thank the 2 1/2 million Americans who helped fund our campaign with an unprecedented 8 million individual campaign contributions  averaging $27 a piece  Let me thank the 13 million Americans who voted for the political revolution  giving us the 1 846 pledged delegates here tonight  46 percent of the total  And delegates  Thank you for being here  and for all the work you've done  I look forward to your votes during the roll call on Tuesday night 
And let me offer a special thanks to the people of my own state of Vermont who have sustained me and supported me as a mayor  congressman  senator and presidential candidate  And to my family  my wife Jane  four kids and seven grandchildren  thank you very much for your love and hard work on this campaign 
I understand that many people here in this convention hall and around the country are disappointed about the final results of the nominating process  I think it's fair to say that no one is more disappointed than I am  But to all of our supporters  here and around the country  I hope you take enormous pride in the historical accomplishments we have achieved 
Together  my friends  we have begun a political revolution to transform America and that revolution  our revolution  continues  Election days come and go  But the struggle of the people to create a government which represents all of us and not just the 1 percent  a government based on the principles of economic  social  racial and environmental justice  that struggle continues  And I look forward to being part of that struggle with you 
Let me be as clear as I can be  This election is not about  and has never been about  Hillary Clinton  or Donald Trump  or Bernie Sanders or any of the other candidates who sought the presidency  This election is not about political gossip  It's not about polls  It's not about campaign strategy  It's not about fundraising  It's not about all the things the media spends so much time discussing 
This election is about  and must be about  the needs of the American people and the kind of future we create for our children and grandchildren 
This election is about ending the 40-year decline of our middle class the reality that 47 million men  women and children live in poverty  It is about understanding that if we do not transform our economy  our younger generation will likely have a lower standard of living then their parents 
This election is about ending the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality that we currently experience  the worst it has been since 1928  It is not moral  not acceptable and not sustainable that the top one-tenth of one percent now own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent  or that the top 1 percent in recent years has earned 85 percent of all new income  That is unacceptable  That must change 
This election is about remembering where we were 7 1/2 years ago when President Obama came into office after eight years of Republican trickle-down economics 
The Republicans want us to forget that as a result of the greed  recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street  our economy was in the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression  Some 800 000 people a month were losing their jobs  We were running up a record-breaking deficit of $1 4 trillion and the world's financial system was on the verge of collapse 
We have come a long way in the last 7 1/2 years  and I thank President Obama and Vice President Biden for their leadership in pulling us out of that terrible recession 
Yes  we have made progress  but I think we can all agree that much  much more needs to be done 
This election is about which candidate understands the real problems facing this country and has offered real solutions  not just bombast  fear-mongering  name-calling and divisiveness 
We need leadership in this country which will improve the lives of working families  the children  the elderly  the sick and the poor  We need leadership which brings our people together and makes us stronger  not leadership which insults Latinos  Muslims  women  African-Americans and veterans  and divides us up 
By these measures  any objective observer will conclude that  based on her ideas and her leadership  Hillary Clinton must become the next president of the United States  The choice is not even close 
This election is about a single mom I saw in Nevada who  with tears in her eyes  told me that she was scared to death about the future because she and her young daughter were not making it on the $10 45 an hour she was earning  This election is about that woman and the millions of other workers in this country who are struggling to survive on totally inadequate wages 
Hillary Clinton understands that if someone in America works 40 hours a week  that person should not be living in poverty  She understands that we must raise the minimum wage to a living wage  And she is determined to create millions of new jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure  our roads  bridges  water systems and wastewater plants 
But her opponent  Donald Trump  well  he has a very different view  He does not support raising the federal minimum wage of $7 25 an hour  a starvation wage  While Donald Trump believes in huge tax breaks for billionaires  he believes that states should actually have the right to lower the minimum wage below $7 25  What an outrage!
This election is about overturning Citizens United  one of the worst Supreme Court decisions in the history of our country  That decision allows the wealthiest people in America  like the billionaire Koch brothers  to spend hundreds of millions of dollars buying elections and  in the process  undermine American democracy 
Hillary Clinton will nominate justices to the Supreme Court who are prepared to overturn Citizens United and end the movement toward oligarchy in this country  Her Supreme Court appointments will also defend a woman's right to choose  workers rights  the rights of the LGBT community  the needs of minorities and immigrants and the government's ability to protect the environment 
If you don't believe this election is important  if you think you can sit it out  take a moment to think about the Supreme Court justices that Donald Trump would nominate and what that would mean to civil liberties  equal rights and the future of our country 
This election is about the thousands of young people I have met who have left college deeply in debt  and the many others who cannot afford to go to college  During the primary campaign  Secretary Clinton and I both focused on this issue but with different approaches  Recently  however  we have come together on a proposal that will revolutionize higher education in America  It will guarantee that the children of any family this country with an annual income of $125 000 a year or less  83 percent of our population  will be able to go to a public college or university tuition free  That proposal also substantially reduces student debt 
This election is about climate change  the greatest environmental crisis facing our planet  and the need to leave this world in a way that is healthy and habitable for our kids and future generations  Hillary Clinton is listening to the scientists who tell us that  unless we act boldly and transform our energy system in the very near future  there will be more drought  more floods  more acidification of the oceans  more rising sea levels  She understands that when we do that we can create hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs 
Donald Trump  Well  like most Republicans  he chooses to reject science  He believes that climate change is a  hoax  no need to address it  Hillary Clinton understands that a president's job is to worry about future generations  not the short-term profits of the fossil fuel industry 
This campaign is about moving the United States toward universal health care and reducing the number of people who are uninsured or under-insured  Hillary Clinton wants to see that all Americans have the right to choose a public option in their health care exchange  She believes that anyone 55 years or older should be able to opt in to Medicare and she wants to see millions more Americans gain access to primary health care  dental care  mental health counseling and low-cost prescription drugs through a major expansion of community health centers 
And What is Donald Trump's position on health care  No surprise there  Same old  same old Republican contempt for working families  He wants to abolish the Affordable Care Act  throw 20 million people off of the health insurance they currently have and cut Medicaid for lower-income Americans 
Hillary Clinton also understands that millions of seniors  disabled vets and others are struggling with the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs and the fact that Americans pay the highest prices in the world for their medicine  She knows that Medicare must negotiate drug prices with the pharmaceutical industry and that drug companies should not be making billions in profits while one in five Americans are unable to afford the medicine they need  The greed of the drug companies must end 
This election is about the leadership we need to pass comprehensive immigration reform and repair a broken criminal justice system  It's about making sure that young people in this country are in good schools and at good jobs  not in jail cells  Hillary Clinton understands that we have to invest in education and jobs for our young people  not more jails or incarceration 
In these stressful times for our country  this election must be about bringing our people together  not dividing us up  While Donald Trump is busy insulting one group after another  Hillary Clinton understands that our diversity is one of our greatest strengths  Yes  We become stronger when black and white  Latino  Asian-American  Native American  all of us  stand together  Yes  We become stronger when men and women  young and old  gay and straight  native born and immigrant fight to create the kind of country we all know we can become 
It is no secret that Hillary Clinton and I disagree on a number of issues  That's what this campaign has been about  That's what democracy is about  But I am happy to tell you that at the Democratic Platform Committee there was a significant coming together between the two campaigns and we produced  by far  the most progressive platform in the history of the Democratic Party  Among many other strong provisions  the Democratic Party now calls for breaking up the major financial institutions on Wall Street and the passage of a 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act  It also calls for strong opposition to job-killing free trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership 
Our job now is to see that platform implemented by a Democratic Senate  a Democratic House and a Hillary Clinton presidency  and I am going to do everything I can to make that happen 
I have known Hillary Clinton for 25 years  I remember her as a great first lady who broke precedent in terms of the role that a first lady was supposed to play as she helped lead the fight for universal health care  I served with her in the United States Senate and know her as a fierce advocate for the rights of children 
Hillary Clinton will make an outstanding president and I am proud to stand with her here tonight 
Mr  President  let me begin by thanking my friend from Virginia for doing what is very important  I think the essence of what he is saying is that today there are millions of Federal employees  people in the Armed Forces  who are doing the very best they can  In many instances  they are doing a great job to protect our country  to keep it safe  And very often  to be honest with you  these folks get dumped on  So it is important that people such as Senator Warner come here and point out individuals who are doing a great job  people of whom we are very proud  So I thank Senator Warner for that  
Mr  President  as I think everyone knows  President Obama and the Republican leadership have reached an agreement on a very significant tax bill  In my view  the agreement they reached is a bad deal for the American people  I think we can do better  
I am here today to take a strong stand against this bill  and I intend to tell my colleagues and the Nation exactly why I am in opposition to this bill  You can call what I am doing today whatever you want  You can call it a filibuster  You can call it a very long speech  I am not here to set any great records or to make a spectacle; I am simply here today to take as long as I can to explain to the American people the fact that we have to do a lot better than this agreement provides  
Let me enumerate some of the reasons I am opposed to this agreement  
First  as everybody knows  this Nation has a recordbreaking $13 8 trillion national debt at the same time as the middle class is collapsing and poverty is increasing  And I think it is important to say a word because I am not necessarily sure a lot of Americans know this about how we got to where we are today in terms of the national debt  
I know there are some people who think this all began the day President Obama took office  Well  that is not quite the case  When President Clinton left office  this country was running  in fact  a very significant surplus  and the projections were that we were going to continue to run a surplus  During the 8 years of President Bush's administration  for a number of reasons the primary reasons being the war in Iraq  the war in Afghanistan  huge tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country  a Medicare Part D prescription drug program  the Wall Street bailout  among other things  all of which were not paid for we saw an almost doubling of the national debt  Since President Obama has been in office  we have passed a stimulus package which has also added to the deficit and national debt  
But here we are today with a $13 8 trillion national debt  a $1 4 trillion deficit  and almost all Americans are in agreement that this is a very serious issue  So the first point I would make is that it seems to me to be unconscionable unconscionable for my conservative friends and for everybody else in this country to be driving up this already too high national debt by giving tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires who don't need it  and in a number of cases they don't even want it  
Here is one of the interesting ironies  There are lists of many very wealthy people who have come forward and said  Sure  I want a tax break  Everybody wants a tax break  But you know what  there are other priorities in this country  and I don't need it  Two of the wealthiest people in the world and these are billionaires Bill Gates of Microsoft and Warren Buffett of Berkshire  say  It is absurd  We don't need a tax break  
All over the country  you hear a lot of folks who have a lot of money saying  Don't drive up the deficit and force our kids to pay higher taxes to pay off the national debt in order to give tax breaks to the richest people in this country  
We have been told not to worry too much because the extension of these tax breaks for the wealthy will only last 2 years not to worry  Maybe that is the case  But given the political reality I have seen in Washington  my guess is that 2 years from now these tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country will be extended again  What happens around here is that the argument will be made that if you end these tax breaks you are raising taxes  That is what we are hearing right now  I see no reason why  in the middle of a Presidential election  those arguments will not be made again and I see no reason not to believe that those tax breaks will be extended again  
(The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore assumed the chair ) 
Mr  SANDERS  Clearly  we have a number of Republicans who want to make that extension permanent  Whether it will ever be made permanent I don't know  But the point is  when you hear folks say it is only a 2-year extension  I suggest you take that with a grain of salt  
Let me say  if in fact we do what the Republicans have wanted to do right now as we enter this debate they wanted a 10-year extension that would add $700 billion to our national debt  I have four kids and I have six grandchildren  None of them has a whole lot of money  I think it is grossly unfair to ask my kids and grandchildren and the children all over this country to be paying higher taxes in order to provide tax breaks for billionaires because we have driven up the national debt  That is plain wrong  I think the vast majority of the American people  whether they are progressives like myself or whether they are conservatives  perceive that concept of giving tax breaks to billionaires when we have such a high national debt makes no sense at all  
Furthermore  it is important to point out that extending income tax breaks to the top 2 percent is not the only unfair tax proposal in this agreement  This agreement between the President and the Republican leadership also calls for a continuation of the Bush era 15-percent tax rate on capital gains and dividends  meaning that those people who make their living off their investments will continue to pay a substantially lower tax rate than firemen  teachers  nurses  carpenters  and virtually all the other working people of this country  I do not think that is fair  That is wrong  If this agreement were to be passed  we would be continuing that unfair arrangement  
On top of all that  this agreement includes a horrendous proposal regarding the estate tax  That is a Teddy Roosevelt initiative  Teddy Roosevelt was talking about this in the early years of the 20th century  It was enacted in 1916 and it was enacted for a couple of reasons  Teddy Roosevelt and the people of that era thought it was wrong that a handful of people could have a huge  concentration of wealth and then give that wealth  transmit that wealth to their children  He did not think that was right  
Furthermore  it was a source  a progressive and fair source  of revenue  Under the agreement struck between the Republican leadership and the President  the estate tax rate  which was 55 percent under President Clinton and let's all remember  we had problems with the economy under President Clinton but very few will deny that during those years we were creating a heck of a lot more jobs than we did under President Bush  That is the fact over 20 million jobs under President Clinton  We lost 600 000 private sector jobs under President Bush  During the Clinton era  the tax rate on the estate tax was 55 percent  What this arrangement would do is lower that tax rate to 35 percent  with an exemption on the first $5 million of an individual's estate and $10 million for couples  
Here is the important point I think many people do not know  I have to confess my Republican friends and their pollsters and their language people have done a very good job  This is the so-called death tax  I think all over America people say this is terrible  I have $50 000 in the bank and I want to leave that to my kids and the Government is going to take 55 percent of that  35 percent of that  What an outrage  
Let us be very clear  This tax applies only only to the top three-tenths of 1 percent of American families; 99 7 percent of American families will not pay one nickel in an estate tax  This is not a tax on the rich  this is a tax on the very  very  very rich  
If my Republican friends had been successful in doing what they want to do  which is eliminate this estate tax completely  it would have cost our Treasury raised the national debt by $1 trillion over a 10-year period  Families such as the Walton family  of Wal-Mart fame  would have received  just this one family  about a $30 billion tax break  
I find it hard to believe when we are talking about massive cuts in programs for working families  when we have this huge national debt  that anybody would be agreeing to lowering the estate tax rate to 35 percent  That is what this agreement does and I think that is a very bad idea  
Once again  while the agreement on the estate tax is for 2 years once again  there is very little doubt in my mind that the Republicans will continue to push for lower and lower estate tax rates because that is what they want  I think Senator Kyl has been pretty clear about this  They want to permanently repeal that tax  That is $1 trillion in tax breaks to the top three-tenths of 1 percent  I think we are down a bad path there and that is another reason why this agreement does not make a whole lot of sense  
Third and this is a very important point that I think has not yet gotten the attention it deserves this agreement contains a payroll tax holiday which would cut $120 billion from Social Security payroll taxes for workers  There are a lot of folks out there who say  This is pretty good  I am a worker  my contribution will go from 6 2 percent today down to 4 2 percent  I will have more money in my paycheck  It is a good idea  
Let's take a deep breath and let's think about it for a second and understand what this whole thing is about  This payroll tax holiday concept  as I understand it  originally started with conservative Republicans  I know the Vice President recently made the point this was originally a Republican idea  Why did the Republicans come up with this idea  These are exactly the same people who do not believe in Social Security  These are the same people who either want to make significant cuts in Social Security or else they want to privatize Social Security entirely  Here is the point  They understand that if we divert funding that is supposed to go into the Social Security trust fund  which is what this payroll tax holiday does  this is money that goes into the Social Security trust fund that is now being diverted  cut back  in order to provide financial support for workers but that is a lot of money not going into the trust fund  
What the President and others are saying is not to worry because that money will be covered by the general fund  That is a very bad and dangerous precedent  Up until now  what Social Security has been about is 100 percent funding from payroll contributions  not from the general tax base  Once again  this is a 1-year program  The loss of revenue going into Social Security can be covered by the general fund  But we have a $13 trillion national debt  How much longer will the general fund put money into Social Security  Is it a good idea for the general fund to be doing that  
I would argue this is not a good idea  This is a very dangerous step forward for those of us who believe in Social Security  But this is not just Bernie Sanders saying this  One of the more effective and I think important senior groups in America is called the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare  I don't know exactly how many but they have many members all over this country  I know they are active in the State of Vermont  I want to read to you from a press release they sent out the other day  This is the headline on it  from the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare  ``Cutting Contributions to Social Security Signals the Beginning of the End  Payroll Tax Holiday Is Anything But '' 
This is what they say  This comes from Barbara Kennelly  Barbara came from the House of Representatives  I have known her for years  She is now the president and CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare  one of the strong senior groups in the country  
Even though Social Security contributed nothing to the current economic crisis  it has been bartered in a deal that provides deficit-busting tax cuts for the wealthy  Diverting $120 billion in Social Security contributions for a so-called ``tax holiday'' may sound like a good deal for workers now  but it's bad business for the program that a majority of middle-class seniors will rely upon in the future  
That is what the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare says about that agreement and I agree with them  For all of us who understand that Social Security is life and death for tens of millions of Americans today and will be vitally important for working people as they reach retirement age  it is important that we understand that Social Security has done a great job  A few minutes ago the Presiding Officer was on the floor talking about the strong work that our Federal employees do  and he is absolutely right  Sometimes we also take for granted that Social Security has been an enormous success  It has done exactly what those people who created it have wanted it to do nothing more  nothing less  It has succeeded  It has taken millions of seniors out of poverty and given them an element of security  It has also helped people with disabilities maintain their dignity  Widows and orphans are also getting help  
For 75 years it has worked well  It has a $2 6 trillion surplus today and it can pay out benefits for the next 29 years  It is strong  We want to make it stronger  This payroll tax holiday I am afraid is a step very much in the wrong direction and that is one of the important reasons why this agreement between the President and the Republicans should be defeated  
Included in the agreement are a number of business tax cuts  I am not going to be here to say that some of them may not work  Some of them may work  Some will work better than others  There is a whole list of them  But this is what I will say  Economists on both ends of the political spectrum believe that if we are serious about addressing the horrendous economic crisis we are in now  9 8 percent unemployment  there are far more effective ways of creating the jobs we have to create than those tax proposals  With corporate America already sitting on close to $2 trillion cash on hand  it is not that our friends in corporate America don't have any money  we have to help them  They have $2 trillion cash on hand  The problem is not in my view that corporate taxes are too high; it is that the middle class simply doesn't have the money to purchase the goods and products that make our economy go and create jobs  
I think if our goal is to create the millions and millions of jobs we need  and if our goal is to make our country stronger internationally in a very tough global economy  I would much prefer  and I think most economists would agree with me that a better way to do that  to create the millions of jobs we have to create  is to invest heavily in our infrastructure  
The truth is and I don't think anyone disputes this  the infrastructure in the United States is crumbling  and I will go into more detail about that later  
I have some very good information on it  But you do not have to be a civil engineer to know that  All you have to do is get in your car today and drive someplace in my State and all over this country  What you are going to see are roads that are in disrepair  You are going to see bridges that  in some cases  have actually been shut down  You are going to see water systems I remember I was in Rutland  VT  the second or third largest city in the State of Vermont  and the mayor showed me a piece of pipe  an old piece of pipe  
He said  You know  the engineer who helped develop this water system and lay this pipe  after he did this work for Rutland  he went off to fight in the war  
I knew there was a catch line coming  I said  What war was it  
He said  It was the Civil War  
So you are talking about water pipe being in Rutland  VT and this is true all over the United States laid in the Civil War  The result is  we lose an enormous amount of clean water every day through leaks and water pipes bursting all over the United States of America  
Well  we can put people to work improving our water systems  our wastewater plants  It is a very expensive proposition to develop a good wastewater plant  I was a mayor  you were a Governor  Mr  President  It is an expensive proposition for roads  bridges  Furthermore  I do not have to tell anybody here  our rail system  which used to be the greatest rail system in the world  is now falling way behind every other major country on Earth  
As a result of the stimulus package  we did a whole lot of very good things in the State of Vermont  One of the things we were able to do was use $50 million of Federal funds and private money to make major repair on one of our important railways in the State  
But we remain far behind most other countries around the industrialized world  China is exploding in terms of the number of high-speed rail lines they have  We have to do better  Our airports need work  Our air controllers need to be updated in terms of the technology they have and use to make our flights safe  
The point is  what most economists would tell you is when you invest in infrastructure  you get a bigger bang for the buck  You create more jobs for your investment than  in most instances  giving a variety of tax breaks to the corporate world  
Second of all  and not unimportantly  when you invest in infrastructure  you are improving the future of this country  You are making us more productive  It is not just creating jobs  it is creating jobs for very specific purposes  which makes our Nation more productive and efficient  
Thirdly  let me tell you something  As a former mayor  infrastructure does not get better if you ignore it  You can turn your back  if you are a mayor or Governor  on the roads and the highways because you do not have the money to fix them today  but they are not going to get better next year  At some point  they are going to have to be repaired and fixed  We may as well do that right now  
So I believe the money  the very substantial sums of money in this agreement between the President and the Republicans  which goes into tax breaks for corporate America  could be effectively spent on infrastructure  
The fifth point I want to make in opposition to this agreement and what we have heard from the President and others is that this is a compromise  You cannot get everything you want  Well  you cannot get everything you want around here is true  but one of the examples of compromise is an extension of unemployment benefits for 13 months  
Well  let me be very clear  In the midst of a serious and major recession  at a time when millions of our fellow Americans are not only out of work through no fault of their own  but they have been out of work for a very long time  it would be  in my view  immoral and wrong to turn our backs on those workers  Their unemployment benefits are going to be running out soon  It is absolutely imperative that we extend those unemployment benefits for the 2 million workers who would lose them  
But here is the point I want to make  Some people say this is a compromise  Well  the Republicans gave on unemployment; the President gave on extending tax breaks for the rich  et cetera  But here is the point  I do not believe  honestly  that the Republican support now for extending unemployment benefits constitutes much of a compromise because the truth is  for the past 40 years  under both Democratic and Republican administrations  under the leadership in the Senate and the House of Democrats or Republicans  it has been bipartisan policy that whenever the unemployment rate has been above 7 2 percent  unemployment insurance has always been extended  So what we have had is longstanding  bipartisan policy  That is what we have always done  That is what we should be doing in the future  I do not regard Republicans now supporting what their party has always supported  extending unemployment benefits when unemployment becomes very high I do not see that as a compromise  I see that as what has been going on in this country and in the Senate for four decades  
I have talked about the negative aspects of this proposal  But I am going to be the first to admit that  of course  there are positive and good agreements in this  And what are they  What are some of the positive aspects of this agreement  Let me just tick them off  
No  1  I believe very strongly  and I know the President does  it is absolutely imperative that we extend middle-class tax cuts for 98 percent of the American people  I do not think there has been any debate about that  
When median family income has gone down by over $2 000 during the Bush years  when millions of our people today are working longer hours for low wages  when people cannot afford to send their kids to college or to take care of childcare  I think it makes absolute sense  I do not think anyone will argue it is absolutely imperative that we extend middle-class tax cuts  That is what this provision does  That is the right thing  
Furthermore  in this agreement we have an extension of the earned-income tax credit for working Americans  and the child and college tax credit are also in there  Every one of these agreements is very important  These programs will keep millions of Americans from slipping out of the middle class and into poverty  They will allow millions of Americans to send their kids to college  
So I am not here to say there is not anything of value in this agreement between the President and the Republicans  There are  and we have to fight to make sure all of those programs remain in the final package when it is passed when the final package is passed  But when we look at the overall agreement  we must put it in a broader context; that is  what will the passage of this legislation mean for the future of our country  
In that area  if you look at it in that context  I think the evidence is pretty strong it is not just a good agreement and not something that should be passed  The passage of this agreement would mean we would continue the Bush policy of trickle-down economics for at least 2 more years  That is not a good thing to do because  I think  as most Americans know  that philosophy  that economic approach  simply did not work  The evidence is quite overwhelming  I do not think there is much debate  when median family income during Bush's 8 years goes down by $2 200  when we end up losing over 600 000 private sector jobs  and all of the job growth was in the Federal level  I do not see how anybody would want to continue that philosophy  But that  in essence  is what will happen if this agreement is passed  
Now  I want to make another point about what happens if if  and I will do my best to prevent this from happening but what would happen if this agreement would pass  Does anybody seriously believe our Republican colleagues would then say  OK  well  we have an extension of tax breaks for the very richest people  We have lowered the tax rate on the estate tax  Those are good victories for millionaires and billionaires  We are going to go home now  We are not going to continue the fight  
I do not think so  We are already hearing sounds about where our Republican friends want to go  The President put together what I thought was a very poor deficit reduction commission  I thought the folks on it were not reflective of the American people  I thought there was very much a big business  corporate partiality there  
The initiatives that came out of that commission which  fortunately  did not get the 14 votes they needed suggest to me that those of us who are concerned about protecting the needs of the middle class and working families are going to have to push back pretty hard for what is coming down the pike  
I think what we will be seeing is if this proposal negotiated between the President and the Republicans is passed  what you will be seeing within a few months are folks coming on the floor of the Senate  and this is what they will say  You know what  The deficit is high  The national debt is too high  And  yes oh  yes we drove the national debt up by giving tax breaks to millionaires  That is the way it goes  But we are going to have to deal with our national debt  
The Republicans will tell you  Oh  we have a great plan to deal with it  We are giving tax breaks to millionaires  But now what we are going to have to do is start making deep cuts in Social Security  and that deficit reduction commission started paving the way for that  very substantial cuts in Social Security  
Maybe we will have to raise the retirement age in Social Security to 69 or 70  Maybe we will have to make cuts in Medicare  Maybe we will have to make cuts in Medicaid  I think we are beginning to see  in the State of Arizona now  what goes on when you make deep cuts in Medicaid  
In Arizona right now there are people who are in line who need transplants  who will die if they do not get transplants  as a result of legislation they passed there  They are saying to people  young people  Sorry  we cannot afford to give you a transplant  and you are going to have to die  
Well  is that what we are looking forward to saying all over America  I certainly will do everything I can to prevent that  
We are certainly going to see a tax on environmental protection  on education  Some of us believe if this country is going to prosper and succeed in the global economy  we have to have the best educational system in the world from childcare through college  
Right now  it is extremely difficult for middle-class families to send their kids to college  Does anyone have any doubt whatsoever that our Republican friends are not going to come back here and say  Oh  we cannot afford to raise Pell Grants as we have in recent years  We cannot afford to support working families who have their kids in childcare  Cut  Cut  Cut  
That is insanity  I am being honest about it  So I would suggest their argument is that we have a high deficit and a high national debt; that if we pass this agreement and the national debt goes higher  it only gives them more impetus to go forward to cut programs that benefit working families and the middle class  
Let me also say there is no doubt in my mind what many not all but many of my Republican colleagues want to do; that is  they want to move this country back into the 1920s when essentially we had an economic and political system which was controlled by big money interests; where working people and the middle class had no programs to sustain them when things got bad  when they got old  and when they got sick; when labor unions were very hard to come by because of antiworker legislation  That is what they want  They do not believe in things like the Environmental Protection Agency  They do not believe in things like Social Security  Medicare  Medicaid  Federal aid to education  That is the fight we will be waging  
I think to surrender on this issue is to simply say we are going to be waging fight after fight  starting within a couple of months  
President Obama has said he fought as hard as he could against the Republican tax breaks for the wealthy and for an extension in unemployment  Well  maybe  But the reality is that fight cannot simply be waged inside the Beltway  Our job is to appeal to the vast majority of the American people to stand up and to say  Wait a minute  I do not want to see our national debt explode  I do not want to see my kids and grandchildren paying higher taxes in order to give tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires  
The vast majority of the American people do not support that agreement in terms of giving tax breaks to the very rich  Our job is to rally those people  I would like very much to see the American people saying to our Republican colleagues and some Democratic colleagues  Excuse me  Don't force my kids to have a lower standard of living in order to give tax breaks to the richest people  
What the President and all of us should be doing is going out and saying to those people  Call the Members of the Senate  call the Members of the House and say  Excuse me  How about representing the middle class and working families  for a change  rather than the wealthiest people  That is what democracy is about  
This fight is not going to be won inside the beltway in a Senate debate  It is going to be won when the American people stand and say  Wait a second  We cannot continue to give tax breaks to people who are doing phenomenally well right now  We cannot give tax breaks to the rich when we already have the most unequal distribution of income of any major country on Earth  The top 1 percent earns 23 percent of all income in America  more than the bottom 50 percent  They don't need more tax breaks to be paid for by our kids and grandchildren  
The vast majority of people are behind us on this issue  but they have to make their voices heard to their Senators  to their Congressmen  When they do  I believe we can come forward with an agreement which protects the middle-class and working families and is not a boondoggle for the wealthiest people  
It is important to put the agreement the President struck with Republicans in a broader context  We can't just look at the agreement unto itself  We have to look at it within the context of what is going on in the country today  both economically and politically  I think I speak for millions of Americans  There is a war going on in this country  I am not referring to the war in Iraq or the war in Afghanistan  I am talking about a war being waged by some of the wealthiest and most powerful people against working families  against the disappearing and shrinking middle class of our country  The billionaires of America are on the warpath  They want more and more and more  That has everything to do with this agreement reached between Republicans and the President  
In 2007  the top 1 percent of all income earners made 23 5 percent of all income  Let me repeat that  The top 1 percent earned over 23 percent of all income; that is  more than the bottom 50 percent  One percent here; fifty percent here  But for the very wealthy  that is apparently not enough  The percentage of income going to the top 1 percent nearly tripled since the 1970s  All over this country people are angry  frustrated  It is true in Vermont  I am sure it is true in Virginia  It is true all over America  But one of the reasons people are angry and frustrated is they are working incredibly hard  In Vermont  I can tell my colleagues  there are people who don't work one job  two jobs; there are people working three jobs and four jobs  trying to cobble together an income in order to support their families  I suspect that goes on all across the country  While people are working harder and harder  in many cases their income is going down  The fact is  80 percent of all new income earned from 1980 to 2005 has gone to the top 1 percent  Let me repeat that because that is an important fact  It explains why the American people are feeling as angry as they are  They are working hard  but they are not going anyplace  In some cases  in many cases  their standard of living is actually going down  Eighty percent of all income in recent years has gone to the top 1 percent  The richer people become much richer  the middle class shrinks  Millions of Americans fall out of the middle class and into poverty  
That is not apparently enough for our friends at the top who have a religious ferocity in terms of greed  They need more  more  It is similar to an addiction  Fifty million is not enough  They need $100 million  One hundred million is not enough; they need 1 billion  One billion is not enough  I am not quite sure how much they need  When will it stop  
Today  in terms of wealth as opposed to income  the top 1 percent now owns more wealth than the bottom 90 percent  When we went to school  we used to read in the textbooks about Latin America  and they used to refer to some of the countries there as ``banana republics '' countries in which a handful of families controlled the economic and political life of the nation  I don't wish to upset the American people  but we are not all that far away from that reality today  The top 1 percent has seen a tripling of the percentage of income they earn  Since the 1970s  the top 1 percent owning 23 percent of all income  more than the bottom 50 percent  The top 1 percent now owns more wealth than the bottom 90 percent  That is not the foundation of a democratic society  That is the foundation for an oligarchic society  The rich get richer  The middle class shrinks  Poverty increases  Apparently  God is not good enough yet for some of the richest people  
I say ``some of the richest'' because there are a lot of folks with a lot of money who do love this country  they are not into greed  but there are some who are  More  more more  that is what they need  
For example this galls me and galls many of the people in this country the horrendous recession we are in right now  where millions and millions of people have lost their jobs  their savings  their homes  this recession was caused by the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street  These guys  through their greed  created the most severe economic recession since the Great Depression  The American people bailed them out  Now  2 years after the bailout  they are giving themselves more compensation than they ever have  They are saying to the American people  Sorry we caused this recession because of our greed  Sorry you are unemployed  Sorry you lost your house  But that is not all that important  What is important is that I  on Wall Street  continue to get millions of dollars in compensation and in bonuses  that I have big parties  How can I get by on one house  I need 5 houses  10 houses  I need three jet planes to take me all over the world  Sorry  We have the money  We have the power  We have the lobbyists here on Wall Street  Tough luck  That is the world  get used to it  
The rich get richer  The middle class shrinks  Not enough  not enough  The very rich seem to want more and more and more  and they are prepared to dismantle the existing political and social order in order to get it  So we have the economics and distribution of income and wealth as one thing  but then we must discuss politics  
What happened last year  as I think most Americans know  is the Supreme Court made a very strange decision  The Supreme Court decided that corporations are people and they have the right of free speech and the right without disclosure all of this is through the Citizens United Supreme Court decision to put as much money as they want into campaigns all over the country  In this last campaign  that is what we saw  Billionaires  in secret  pouring money into campaigns all over the country  Does that sound like democracy to anybody in America; that we have a handful of billionaires probably dividing up the country  I will put this amount in Virginia  California  wherever  
That is what they were able to do  The rich get richer  and they don't sit on this money  What they then do is use it to elect people who support them and to unelect people who oppose their agenda and they use their political power to get legislation passed which makes the wealthy even wealthier  
One of the manifestations of that is  in fact  the agreement reached between the President and the Republican leadership  The wealthy contribute huge sums of money into campaigns  The wealthy have all kinds of lobbyists around here through corporate America  What they are going to get out of this agreement are huge tax breaks that benefit themselves  That is not what we should be supporting  
We should understand this agreement is just the beginning of an assault on legislation and programs that have benefited the American people for 70 or 80 years  Mark my words  there will be an intensive effort to privatize Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid  Furthermore  it is part of the Republican agenda  They want to expand and it is not only Republicans here  some Democrats as well our disastrous trade policies so large companies can continue their efforts to outsource American jobs to China and other low-wage countries  Any objective analysis of our trade policies has shown it has been a grotesque failure for ordinary Americans  It is hard to calculate exactly  but I think it is fair to say we have lost millions of decent-paying jobs  During the Bush years alone  some 48 000 factories shut down  We went from 19 million manufacturing jobs to 12 million manufacturing jobs  Historically  in this country  manufacturing jobs were the backbone of the working class  That is how people made it into the middle class  That is how they had decent health care benefits and pensions  Every day we are seeing those jobs disappear because corporate America would prefer to do business in China or other low-wage countries  
I returned from a trip to Vietnam last year  a beautiful country  People there work for 25  30 cents an hour  Sometimes when you go to a store  you may see a shirt made in Bangladesh  That shirt  in all likelihood  is made by a young girl who came in from the countryside to one of the factories there  The good news is that in Bangladesh  the minimum wage was doubled  It went from 11 cents an hour to 23 cents an hour  
Are American workers going to be able to compete against desperate people who make 23 cents an hour  
So my view and I think it reflects the views of the American people is that of course we want to see the people of Bangladesh and the people of China do well  But they do not have to do well at the expense of the American middle class  We do not have to engage in a race to the bottom  Our goal is to bring them up  not us down  But one of the results of our disastrous trade policies is that in many instances wages in the United States have gone down  
I believe in the coming months you are going to see an intensification of efforts to expand unfettered free trade  I think that will be a continuation of a disastrous policy for American workers  
Let me personalize this a little bit  This gentleman  shown in this picture I have in the Chamber I have no personal animus toward him at all; I think I met him once in a large room  His name is James Dimon  He is the CEO of JPMorgan Chase  Over the past 5 years  Mr  Dimon  who is the CEO of JPMorgan Chase  received $89 million in total compensation a bank that we now know received hundreds of billions in low-interest loans and other financial assistance from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department  
So Mr  Dimon received $89 million in total compensation  His bank was bailed out big time by the taxpayers  But under the legislation the President negotiated with the Republicans  Mr  Dimon I use him just as one example for thousands; nothing personal to Mr  Dimon will receive $1 1 million in tax breaks  So $1 1 million in tax breaks for a major CEO on Wall Street  who over the last 5 years received $89 million in total compensation  
Meanwhile just to contrast what is going on here 2 days ago  I brought before the Senate legislation which would provide a $250 one-time check to over 50 million seniors and disabled veterans  who for the last 2 years have not received a COLA on their Social Security  Many of those seniors and disabled vets are trying to get by on $14 000  $15 000  $18 000 a year  The total package for that bill was approximately $14 billion that would go out to over 50 million seniors and disabled vets  We won that vote on the floor of the Senate 53 to 45  But just because you get 53 votes in the Senate does not mean you win  Because the Republicans filibustered  I needed 60 votes  I could not get 60 votes  I could not get one Republican vote to provide a $250 check to a disabled veteran trying to get by on $15 000 or $16 000 a year  
But Mr  Dimon  who made $89 million in the last 5 years  will get a $1 million tax deduction if this agreement is passed  Now  that may make sense to some people  It does not make a lot of sense to me  
Again  I have no particular knowledge  animus I do not know if I ever met John Mack in my life  He is the CEO of Morgan Stanley  In 2006  he received a $40 million bonus  which at the time was the largest bonus ever given to a Wall Street executive  
Two years after receiving this bonus  Morgan Stanley received some $2 trillion in low-interest loans and billions from the Treasury Department  Instead of losing his job  under this agreement  Mr  Mack will be receiving an estimated $926 000 tax break next year  Congratulations  Mr  Mack  You are doing fine  We could not get $250 for a disabled vet  
Over the past 5 years  Ken Lewis  the former CEO of Bank of America  received over $165 million in total compensation  In 2008  Bank of America received hundreds of billions in taxpayer-backed loans from the Fed and a $45 billion bailout from the Treasury Department  
What will Mr  Lewis receive if the agreement negotiated between the President and the Republicans goes forth  He will get a $713 000 tax cut  
And on and on it goes  I did not mean to specifically pick on these guys  Some of the wealthiest people in the country will be receiving a million-dollar-plus tax break  So we as a nation have to decide whether that makes a lot of sense  I think it does not  
Let me mention that a couple weeks ago the Fed  the Federal Reserve  published on their Web site some 21 000 transactions that took place during the Wall Street meltdown period  That disclosure was made possible as part of a provision that I put into the financial reform bill because I thought it was important the American people  for the first time  lift the veil of secrecy at the Fed and get a sense of the kind of money that was lent out by the Fed and who received that money  
What is very interesting is that the American people and the media have focused on the $700 billion Wall Street bailout now known as TARP  I happen to have voted against that agreement  but  in fairness  that agreement was pretty transparent  The Treasury Department put up on their Web site all of those banks and financial institutions that received the money  If you want to know where the money went  it is right up there on the Treasury Department's Web site  
But at the same time  a bigger transaction than TARP was taking place  which got relatively little attention  and that was the role the Fed was playing in terms of the Wall Street bailout  
While the TARP issue was being debated during that period  Ben Bernanke  the Chairman of the Federal Reserve  Tim Geithner  who was then the president of the New York Fed  and a handful of other very powerful people were sitting behind closed doors getting ready to lend out trillions underline trillions of taxpayer dollars to large financial institutions and corporations  with no debate going on in Congress  no debate whatsoever  
On March 3  2009 and I am a member of the Senate Budget Committee I asked the Fed Chairman  Mr  Bernanke  to tell the American people the names of the financial institutions that received this unprecedented backdoor bailout from the Fed  how much they received  and the exact terms of this assistance  I will never forget that  I asked Mr  Bernanke for that information  He said  Senator  no  not going to give it to you  not going to make it public  
Well  on that day  I introduced legislation to make that information public  working with a number of Members of the House and the Senate  Some strange bedfellows conservatives and progressives came together on this issue  We managed to get in the Wall Street reform bill a disclosure provision  and on December 1 last week that information was made public  Let me talk a little bit about what was in that information made public by the Fed  
After years of stonewalling  the American people have learned the incredible  jaw-dropping details of the Fed's multimillion-dollar bailout of Wall Street and corporate America not just Wall Street  It is one of the things we learned  As a result of this disclosure  in my view we are going to get into what was in what we learned Congress has to take a very extensive look at all aspects of how the Federal Reserve functions and how we can make our financial institutions more responsive to the needs of ordinary Americans and small businesses  
What have we learned from the disclosure of December 1  This is based on an examination of over 21 000 separate Federal Reserve transactions  More work  more research needs to be done  But this is what we have learned so far  
As it turns out  while small business owners in the State of Vermont and throughout this country were being turned down for loans  not only did large financial institutions and I am talking about every major financial institution receive substantial help from the Fed  but also some of the largest corporations in this country not financial institutions also received help in terms of very low interest loans  
So you have every major financial institution  you have some of our largest private corporations  but here is something we also learned  and that is that this bailout impacted not just American banks and corporations but also foreign banks and foreign corporations as well  to the tune of many billions of dollars  
Then  on top of that  a number of the wealthiest individuals in this country also received a major bailout from the Fed  The ``emergency response '' which is what the Fed described their action as during the Wall Street collapse  appears to any objective observer to have been the clearest case that I can imagine of socialism for the very rich and rugged free market capitalism for everybody else  
In other words  if you are a huge financial institution  whose recklessness and greed caused this great recession  no problem  You are going to receive a substantial amount of help from the taxpayers of this country  If you are a major American corporation  such as General Electric or McDonald's or Caterpillar or Harley-Davidson or Verizon  no problem  You are going to receive a major handout from the U S  Government  
But if you are a small business in Vermont or California or Virginia  well  guess what  you are on your own because right now we know one of the real impediments to the kind of job creation we need in this country is that small businesses are not getting the loans they need  
Furthermore  what we now know is the extent of the bailout for the large financial corporations  Goldman Sachs received nearly $600 billion  Morgan Stanley received nearly $2 trillion  Citigroup received $1 8 trillion  Bear Stearns received nearly $1 trillion  And Merrill Lynch received some $1 5 trillion in short-term loans from the Fed  
But I think what is most surprising for the American people is not just the bailout of Wall Street and the financial institutions  and the bailout of large American corporations such as General Electric  but I think the American people would find it very strange that at a time when the American automobile sector was on the verge of collapse and goodness only knows how many thousands and thousands of jobs we have lost in automobile manufacturing in this country the Federal Reserve was also bailing out Toyota and Mitsubishi  two Japanese carmakers  by purchasing nearly $5 billion worth of their commercial paper from November 5  2008  through January 30  2009  
While virtually no American-made cars or products of any kind are bought in Japan  I think the American people would be shocked to learn that the Fed extended over $380 billion to the Central Bank of Japan to bail out banks in that country  
Furthermore  I think the American people are interested to know that the Fed bailed out the Korea Development Bank  the wholly owned  state-owned Bank of South Korea  by purchasing over $2 billion of its commercial paper  The sole purpose of the Korea Development Bank is to finance and manage major industrial projects to enhance the national economy not of the United States of America but of South Korea  I am not against South Korea  I wish the South Koreans all the luck in the world  But it should not be the taxpayers of the United States lending their banks' money to create jobs in South Korea  I would suggest maybe we want to create jobs in the United States of America  At the same time  the Fed also extended over $40 billion for the Central Bank of South Korea so that it had enough money to bail out its own banks  
At a time when small businesses in Vermont and all over this country cannot get the loans they need to expand their businesses  I think the American people would find it extremely I don't know what the word is maybe amusing that the Fed bailed out the state-owned Bank of Bavaria not Pennsylvania  not California  but Bavaria by purchasing over $2 2 billion of its commercial paper  
Furthermore  when we cannot get support on the floor of this Senate to extend unemployment benefits to millions of Americans who are on the verge of seeing them expire  I think the American people would find it incomprehensible that the Fed chose to bail out the Arab Banking Corporation based in Bahrain by providing them with over $23 billion in loans with an interest rate as low as one-quarter of 1 percent  So small businessmen all over America  Maybe you have to run to Bahrain and work with the Arab Banking Corporation there to get some pretty good loans  But it would be nice if maybe the Fed would start to pay attention to banks in this country  
Furthermore  the Fed extended over $9 6 billion to the Central Bank of Mexico  
What is interesting about all of this is that we had a very vigorous debate here in the Senate and in the House over the $700 billion TARP program  Every person in America could turn on C-SPAN and hear that debate  They could hear what President Bush had to say  hear what then-Senator Obama and Senator McCain had to say  It was all pretty public  But what took place at the Fed  which  in fact  amounted to a larger bailout  was done behind closed doors  Over $3 trillion was lent with zero transparency  In fact  as a result of this recent disclosure this is the first time we have gotten a glimpse of the magnitude and the particulars  the specificities of where that money was lent  and I think this is not a good thing for this country  Again  I voted against the bailout of Wall Street  but the debate was open and public  People wrote to their Senators and called their Senators  That is called democracy  After the TARP bailout took place  all of the loans were put up on the Web site  Transparency the American people knew who got the money  But the actions of the Fed were done behind closed doors  and  in my view it is an issue we are studying right now I think there were significant conflicts of interest  I think we had people sitting there at the New York Fed who were beneficiaries of this bailout  and that is an issue we need to explore  I should tell my colleagues that as part of the provision we got into the financial reform bill  the GAO is  in fact  doing just that investigating possible conflicts of interest at the Fed with regard to this bailout  
I think the question the American people are asking as they read about what the Fed did during the financial crisis is whether the Fed has now become the central bank of the world without any debate on the floor of the Senate or the Congress and without the knowledge of the American people  I think that is wrong  So I hope  out of this effort in bringing disclosure and transparency to the Fed  that one of the things that will come will be more transparency at the Fed  
As I indicated a moment ago  the Fed said this bailout was necessary in order to prevent the world economy from going over a cliff  But 3 years after the start of the recession  millions of Americans remain unemployed and have lost their homes  their life savings  and their ability to send their kids to college  Meanwhile  huge banks and large corporations have returned to making incredible profits and paying their executives recordbreaking compensation packages  as if the financial crisis they started never occurred  
What this recent disclosure tells us  among many other things  is that despite this huge taxpayer bailout  the Fed did not make the appropriate demands on these financial institutions which would have been necessary to rebuild our economy and protect the needs of ordinary Americans  In other words  what they simply did was give out billions and billions of dollars which were used in the self-interests of these financial institutions rather than saying  The American people who are hurting are bailing you out  and now that they have bailed you out  your responsibility is to do what you can to create jobs and to improve the standard of living of the people  many of whose lives you have severely impacted  
Let me give a few examples of what could have been done and what should be done  At a time when big banks have nearly $1 trillion in excess reserves parked at the Fed  the Fed has not required these institutions to increase lending to small and medium-sized businesses as a condition of the bailout  In other words  instead of the Fed just giving money to these financial institutions  the Fed should have said  We are giving you this money in order to get it into the economy  Start providing affordable loans to small businesses  
At a time when large corporations are more profitable than ever  the Fed did not demand that corporations that received this backdoor bailout create jobs and expand the economy once they returned to profitability  So what is going on in America  Unemployment is officially at 9 8 percent and in a real sense probably at 15 or 16 percent  but Wall Street is now doing fine  
A few years ago  Wall Street earned some 40 percent of all profits in America  and they are doing great  But what the Fed should have done and should do now is to tell Wall Street  You are part of the economy  You are not an isolated area just living for yourselves  You have to be a part of the productive economy  You have to lend money to small businesses to start creating jobs  
My office intends to investigate whether these secret Fed loans  in some cases  turned out to be direct corporate welfare to big banks that may have used those loans not to reinvest in the economy but  rather  to lend back to the Federal Government at a higher rate of interest by purchasing Treasury securities  Now  we don't know that  Maybe that is true  maybe it is not true  but we will take a look at it  In other words  did the Fed give one-half of 1 percent loans to a bank and that bank then purchased a Treasury security at 2 or 3 percent  If so  you have a 2-percent profit margin  and that is nothing but corporate welfare  The goal of the bailout was not to make Wall Street richer; the goal was to expand our economy and put people to work  
Furthermore  we know that as part of the TARP agreement  there was an effort to say to the financial institutions  We are not bailing you out in order for you to get huge compensation packages  We are not going to give you Federal money so you can make all kinds of money  We put limitations on executive compensation  
Did the Fed play the role of allowing some of the large financial institutions to pay back the TARP money  use the Fed money  and then continue with their very high executive compensation  We don't know  but it is worth investigating  
Furthermore and this is an issue I have worked on for a number of years  We know every major religion on Earth Christianity  Judaism  Islam  you name it has always felt that usury is immoral  What we mean by usury is that when someone doesn't have a lot of money and you loan them money  you don't get blood out of a stone  You can't ask for outrageously high interest rates when somebody is hurting  That is immoral  Every major religion  all great philosophers have written about this  Yet today we have millions of people in our country and I hear from Vermonters every week on this issue who are paying 25 percent or 30 percent and in some cases even higher interest rates on their credit cards 20 percent  30 percent interest rates  That is getting blood out of a stone  Yet many of the credit card companies were bailed out by the taxpayers of this country  What the Fed must do is say to those companies  Sorry  you can't continue to rip off the American people and charge them 25 percent or 30 percent interest rates  
As it happens  the four largest banks in this country  which are Bank of America  JPMorgan Chase  Wells Fargo  and Citigroup  issue half of all mortgages in this country  Four huge financial institutions issue half of all mortgages in this country  That unto itself is a huge problem  They issue half of all mortgages  two-thirds of all credit cards  That speaks to another issue about the need to start bringing up these financial institutions  But when you have a handful of banks that received huge bailouts from the Federal Government that are issuing two-thirds of the credit cards in this country  it seems to me to be somewhat absurd that the Fed did not say to them  Sorry  you can't charge people 25 or 30 percent interest rates on your credit cards  The same principle applies to mortgages  I don't have to tell anybody in this country that we have seen millions of folks lose their homes through foreclosure  and once again we see that the four largest banks in this country Bank of America  JPMorgan Chase  Wells Fargo  and Citigroup issue half of all mortgages  Four banks issue two-thirds of the credit cards and half of the mortgages  We bail these financial institutions out  Don't they have some responsibility to the American people  How many more Americans could have remained in their homes if the Fed had required those bailed-out banks to reduce mortgage payments as a condition of receiving these secret loans  
In terms of the interest rates on credit cards  a lot of people don't know this  but right now the banks are able to charge as much as they want to charge  but  in fact  credit unions are not  
Right now  we are looking at a situation where over one-quarter of all credit cardholders in this country are now paying interest rates above 20 percent and in some cases as high as 79 percent  In my view  when credit card companies charge over 20 percent interest  they are not engaged in the business of making credit available to their customers; they are involved in extortion and loan-sharking nothing essentially different than gangsters who charge outrageously high prices for their loans and who break kneecaps when their victims can't afford to pay them  So that is where we are right now  
I get calls and I am sure every other Senator gets calls from constituents who are very upset  They are going deeper and deeper into debt because they can't pay 25 or 30 percent interest rates on their credit cards  We bailed out the credit card companies  There was no provision that said  Stop ripping off the American people  Stop these companies from committing usury  
We are working on legislation that would say to these private banks not to charge any more money for the credit they provide than do the credit unions  It is going to be a tough fight because the lobbyists from Wall Street are all over this place  Wall Street spends huge amounts of money in campaign contributions  and it is going to be tough  But I think we need to pass that  I think the Fed needs to be much more active  in terms of what kinds of interest rates credit card companies should be paying  
Today  I am going to focus a lot  obviously  on an agreement reached between the President and the Republican leadership  which I think does not serve the American people well  One of the areas  as I mentioned earlier  where I think we could do a lot better in addressing the crisis of high unemployment in this Nation is by investing the kinds of money we need in our infrastructure  
According to the American Society of Civil Engineers  they graded America's roads  public transit  and aviation with a D  They said we must invest $2 2 trillion over the next 5 years simply to get a passable grade  Unfortunately  in the agreement struck between the President and the Republican leadership  to the best of my knowledge  not one nickel is going into investing in our infrastructure  
Let me tell you why we need to invest in infrastructure  A  that is where you can create the millions of jobs we desperately need in order to get us out of this recession  Second of all  we need to invest in infrastructure because  if we don't  we will become less and less competitive internationally  
According to the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission  $225 billion is needed annually for the next 50 years to upgrade our surface transportation system to a state of good repair and create a more advanced system  The Federal Highway Administration reports that $130 billion must be invested annually for a 20-year period to improve our bridges and the operational performance of our highways  At present  one in four of the Nation's bridges is either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete  One in four of our bridges is either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete  Yet in this agreement struck by the President and the Republican leadership  to the best of my knowledge  not one nickel is going into our infrastructure  We need to invest in our infrastructure  We need to improve our infrastructure  When we do that  we can create millions of jobs  
The Federal Transit Administration says $22 billion must be invested annually for a 20-year period to improve conditions and performances for our major transit systems  In Vermont  the situation is no different than in the rest of the country  Thirty-five percent of Vermont's 2 700 bridges nearly 1 000 bridges are functionally obsolete  In recent years  we have had to shut down bridges  which caused a lot of inconvenience to people who live in those areas  to workers who had to get to work using a bridge  Nearly half the bridges in Vermont have structural deficiencies  Rural transit options are few and far between  making rural  low-income Vermonters especially vulnerable to spikes in gas prices  In other words  in Vermont  and in other areas of rural America  you have one choice in the vast majority of cases as to how you get to work  That one choice is that you get in your car  you pay $3 for a gallon of gas  and that is it  That is because rural transportation in this country is very weak  
We can create jobs building the buses and vans we need  making it easier and cheaper for workers in rural America to get to work  In urban areas  it is no different  Transit systems in Chicago  New York  and even here in Washington  DC  are in disrepair  Let's improve and repair them  That makes us more efficient  more productive  and more competitive  and it creates jobs now  Not one nickel  as far as I can understand  has been invested in our infrastructure in this agreement  
The United States invests just 2 4 percent of GDP in infrastructure; whereas  Europe invests twice that amount  
Here is something I think every American should be keenly aware of and very worried about  I don't have to tell anybody that the Chinese economy is exploding every single day in almost every way  In China  they are investing almost four times our rate or 9 percent of their GDP annually in their infrastructure  Years ago  I was in Shanghai  China  I was coming from the airport to downtown as part of a congressional delegation  While we were on the bus coming in  my wife noticed something  She said  What was that  There was a blur that went by the window  Of course  I didn't notice it; she did  It turned out that blur was an experimental train they were working on high-speed rail  which is now operational there  and other similar prototypes are being developed in China  Here we are  the United States of America  which for so many years led the world in so many ways  and now you are seeing a newly developing country such as China with high-speed rail all over their country  making them more productive and efficient  and in our cities  our subways are breaking down  Amtrak is going 50  60 miles an hour  and the Chinese and Europeans have trains going hundreds of miles an hour  
This is the United States of America  Maybe I am old-fashioned  I think we can do it too  I think we can rebuild our rail system  make our country more efficient and create jobs  
China invested $186 billion in rail from 2006 to 2009  and according to the New York Times  within 2 years  they will open 42 new high-speed rail lines  with trains reaching speeds of 200 miles an hour  That is China  So I think if China can do it  the United States of America can do it  That is the way to rebuild America  make us stronger and create jobs  
By 2020  China plans to add 26 000 additional miles of tracks for freight and travel  as well as 230 000 miles of new or improved roads  and 97 new airports 97 new airports  Does anybody in America have the same problem I have when you go to the airport  where you are waiting in line and you have to deal with all the problems of older airports  China is building 97 new ones  We are not  If we are going to be effective in the international economy  and if our kids will have decent jobs  it is high time we woke up and began investing in our infrastructure  So that is not only to improve the long-term strength of America  our economic prowess  but it is also to create jobs right now that we desperately need
