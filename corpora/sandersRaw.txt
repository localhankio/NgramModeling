The American people are catching on  They understand that something is profoundly wrong when  in our country today  the top one-tenth of 1 percent own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent and when the 20 richest people own more wealth than the bottom 150 million Americans  half of our population  They know that the system is rigged when the average person is working longer hours for lower wages  while 58 percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent 
They also know that a handful of people on Wall Street have extraordinary power over the economic and political life of our country  As most people know  in the 1990s and later  the financial interests spent billions of dollars in lobbying and campaign contributions to force through Congress the deregulation of Wall Street  the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act and the weakening of consumer protection laws in states 
They spent this money in order to get the government off their backs and to show the American people what they could do with that new-won freedom  Well  they sure showed the American people  In 2008  the greed  recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street nearly destroyed the U S  and global economy 
Millions of Americans lost their jobs  their homes and their life savings 
While Wall Street received the largest taxpayer bailout in the history of the world with no strings attached  the American middle class continues to disappear  poverty is increasing and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing wider and wider  And Wall Street executives still receive huge compensation packages as if the financial crisis they created never happened 
Greed  fraud  dishonesty and arrogance  these are the words that best describe the reality of Wall Street today 
So  to those on Wall Street who may be listening today  let me be very clear  Greed is not good  In fact  the greed of Wall Street and corporate America is destroying the fabric of our nation  And  here is a New Years Resolution that I will keep if elected president  If you do not end your greed  we will end it for you 
We will no longer tolerate an economy and a political system that has been rigged by Wall Street to benefit the wealthiest Americans in this country at the expense of everyone else 
While President Obama deserves credit for improving this economy after the Wall Street crash  the reality is that a lot of unfinished business remains to be done 
Our goal must be to create a financial system and an economy that works for all Americans  not just a handful of billionaires
That means we have got to end  once and for all  the scheme that is nothing more than a free insurance policy for Wall Street  the policy of too big to fail 
We need a banking system that is part of the productive economy making loans at affordable rates to small- and medium-sized businesses so that we create decent-paying jobs  Wall Street cannot continue to be an island unto itself  gambling trillions in risky financial instruments  making huge profits and assured that  if their schemes fail  the taxpayers will be there to bail them out 
In 2008  the taxpayers of this country bailed out Wall Street because we were told they were too big to fail  Yet  today  3 out of the 4 largest financial institutions (JP Morgan Chase  Bank of America and Wells Fargo) are nearly 80 percent bigger than before we bailed them out  Incredibly  the six largest banks in this country issue more than two-thirds of all credit cards and more than 35 percent of all mortgages  They control more than 95 percent of all financial derivatives and hold more than 40 percent of all bank deposits  Their assets are equivalent to nearly 60 percent of our GDP  Enough is enough 
If a bank is too big to fail  it is too big to exist  When it comes to Wall Street reform that must be our bottom line  This is true not just from a risk perspective and the fear of another bailout  It is also true from the reality that a handful of huge financial institutions simply have too much economic and political power over this country 
If Teddy Roosevelt  the Republican trust-buster  were alive today  he would say break em up  And he would be right 
And  heres how I will accomplish that 
Within the first 100 days of my administration  I will require the secretary of the Treasury Department to establish a Too-Big-to Fail list of commercial banks  shadow banks and insurance companies whose failure would pose a catastrophic risk to the United States economy without a taxpayer bailout 
Within one year  my administration will break these institutions up so that they no longer pose a grave threat to the economy as authorized under Section 121 of the Dodd-Frank Act 
And  I will fight to reinstate a 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act to clearly separate commercial banking  investment banking and insurance services  Let's be clear  this legislation  introduced by my colleague Senator Elizabeth Warren  aims at the heart of the shadow banking system 
In my view  Senator Warren  is right  Dodd-Frank should have broken up Citigroup and other  too- big-to-fail banks into pieces  And that's exactly what we need to do  And that's what I commit to do as president 
Now  my opponent  Secretary Clinton says that Glass-Steagall would not have prevented the financial crisis because shadow banks like AIG and Lehman Brothers  not big commercial banks  were the real culprits 
Secretary Clinton is wrong 
Shadow banks did gamble recklessly  but where did that money come from  It came from the federally-insured bank deposits of big commercial banks  something that would have been banned under the Glass-Steagall Act 
Let's not forget  President Franklin Roosevelt signed this bill into law precisely to prevent Wall Street speculators from causing another Great Depression  And  it worked for more than five decades until Wall Street watered it down under President Reagan and killed it under President Clinton 
And  let's not kid ourselves  The Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department didn't just bail out shadow banks  As a result of an amendment that I offered to audit the emergency lending activities of the Federal Reserve during the financial crisis  we learned that the Fed provided more than $16 trillion in short-term  low-interest loans to every major financial institution in the country including Citigroup  JP Morgan Chase  Bank of America  Wells Fargo  not to mention large corporations  foreign banks  and foreign central banks throughout the world 
Secretary Clinton says we just need to impose a few more fees and regulations on the financial industry  I disagree 
As former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich has said and I quote   Giant Wall Street banks continue to threaten the wellbeing of millions of Americans  but what to do  Bernie Sanders says break them up and resurrect the Glass-Steagall Act that once separated investment from commercial banking  Hillary Clinton says charge them a bit more and oversee them more carefully  Hillary Clinton's proposals would only invite more dilution and finagle  The only way to contain the Street's excesses is with reforms so big  bold  and public they can't be watered down  busting up the biggest banks and resurrecting Glass-Steagall  Secretary Reich is right  Real Wall Street reform means breaking up the big banks and re-establishing firewalls that separates risk taking from traditional banking 
My opponent says that  as a senator  she told bankers to  cut it out and end their destructive behavior  But  in my view  establishment politicians are the ones who need to  cut it out  The reality is that Congress doesn't regulate Wall Street  Wall Street  its lobbyists and their billions of dollars regulate Congress  We must change that reality  and as president I will 
It is no secret that millions of Americans have become disillusioned with our political process  They don't vote  They don't believe much of what comes out of Washington  They don't think anyone is there representing their interests  In my view  one of the reasons for that deep disillusionment is the widespread understanding that our criminal justice system is broken and grossly unfair  and that we do not have equal justice under the law  The average American sees kids being arrested and sometimes even jailed for possessing marijuana or other minor crimes  But when it comes to Wall Street executives  some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in this country  whose illegal behavior caused pain and suffering for millions  somehow nothing happens to them  No police record  No jail time  No justice 
We live in a country today that has an economy that is rigged  a campaign finance system which is corrupt and a criminal justice system which  too often  does not dispense justice 
Not one major Wall Street executive has been prosecuted for causing the near collapse of our entire economy 
That will change under my administration   Equal Justice Under Law will not just be words engraved on the entrance of the Supreme Court  It will be the standard that applies to Wall Street and all Americans 
It seems like almost every few weeks we read about one giant financial institution after another being fined or reaching settlements for their reckless  unfair and deceptive activities 
Some people believe that this is an aberration  that we have an honest financial system in which  every now and then  major financial institutions do something wrong and get caught  In my view  the evidence suggests that would be an incorrect analysis 
The reality is that fraud is the business model on Wall Street  It is not the exception to the rule  It is the rule  And in a weak regulatory climate the likelihood is that Wall Street gets away with a lot more illegal behavior than we know of 
How many times have we heard the myth that what Wall Street did may have been wrong but it wasn't illegal 
Let me help shatter that myth today 
Since 2009  major financial institutions in this country have been fined $204 billion  $204 billion  And that takes place in a weak regulatory climate 
Here are just a few examples of when major banks were caught doing illegal activity 
In August 2014  Bank of America settled a case with the Department of Justice for more than $16 billion on charges that the bank misled investors about the riskiness of mortgage-backed securities it sold in the run-up to the crisis 
In November of 2013  JP Morgan settled a case for $13 billion with the Department of Justice and the Federal Housing Finance Agency over charges the bank knowingly sold securities made up of low-quality mortgages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 
In June of 2014  BNP Paribas was sentenced to five years probation and was ordered to pay $8 9 billion in penalties by a U S  District Judge in Manhattan after this bank pled guilty to charges of violating sanctions by conducting business in Sudan  Iran and Cuba 
Let me read you a few headlines and you tell me how it makes sense that not one executive was prosecuted for fraud 
CNN Headline  May 20  2015   5 big banks pay $5 4 billion for rigging currencies  Those banks include JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup 
Headline from the International Business Times (February 24  2015):  Big Banks Under Investigation For Allegedly Fixing Precious Metals Prices  The Banks under investigation included Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase 
Headline from The Real News Network (November 26  2013):  Documents in JPMorgan settlement reveal how every large bank in the U S  has committed mortgage fraud  Headline from The Washington Post (March 14  2014):  In lawsuit  FDIC accuses 16 big banks of fraud  conspiracy  which included Bank of America  Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase 
Headline from the Guardian (April 2  2011):  How a big U S  bank laundered billions from Mexico's murderous drug gangs  This article talks about how Wachovia (which was acquired by Wells Fargo) aided Mexican drug cartels in transferring billions of dollars in illegal drug money  Here is what the federal prosecutor (Jeffrey Sloman) said about this   Wachovia's blatant disregard for our banking laws gave international cocaine cartels a virtual carte blanche to finance their operations  Yet  the total fine for this offense was less than 2% of the bank's $12 3 billion profit for 2009 and no one went to jail  No one went to jail 
And  if that's not bad enough  here's another one 
Headline  The Wall Street Journal  February 9  2011   J P  Morgan Apologizes for Military Foreclosures  Here is a case where JP Morgan Chase  the largest bank in America  wrecked the finances of 4 000 military families in violation of the Civil Service Members Relief Act  yet no one went to jail 
And  when I say that the business model of Wall Street is fraud that is not just Bernie Sanders talking  That is what financial executives told the University of Notre Dame in a study on the ethics of the financial services industry last year 
According to this study  51 percent of Wall Street executives making more than $500 000 a year found it likely that their competitors have engaged in unethical or illegal activity in order to gain an edge in the market 
More than one-third of financial executives have either witnessed or have firsthand knowledge of wrongdoing in the workplace 
Nearly one in five financial service professionals believe they must engage in illegal or unethical activity to be successful 
Twenty-five percent of financial executives have signed or been asked to sign a confidentiality agreement that would prohibit reporting illegal or unethical activities to the authorities 
Here's what one banker from Barclays said in 2010  when he was caught trying to price-fix the $5 trillion-per-day currency market   If you ain't cheating  you ain't trying  Here's what an analyst from Standard & Poors said in 2008   Let's hope we are all wealthy and retired by the time this house of cards falters  This country can no longer afford to tolerate the culture of fraud and corruption on Wall Street 
Under my administration  Wall Street CEOs will no longer receive a get-out-of jail free card  Big banks will not be too big to fail  Big bankers will not be too big to jail 
As president  I will nominate and appoint people with a track record of standing up to power  rather than those who have made millions defending Wall Street CEOs  Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks will not be represented in my administration 
And  if we are serious about reforming our financial system  we have got to establish a tax on Wall Street speculators  We have got to discourage reckless gambling on Wall Street and encourage productive investments in the job-creating economy 
We will use the revenue from this tax to make public colleges and universities tuition free  During the financial crisis  the middle class of this country bailed out Wall Street  Now  it's Wall Street's turn to help the middle class 
We cannot have a safe and sound financial system if we cannot trust the credit agencies to accurately rate financial products  And  the only way we can restore that trust is to make sure credit rating agencies cannot make a profit from Wall Street 
Investors would not have bought the risky mortgage backed derivatives that led to the Great Recession if credit agencies did not give these worthless financial products triple-A ratings  ratings that they knew were bogus 
And  the reason these risky financial schemes were given such favorable ratings is simple  Wall Street paid for them 
Under my administration  we will turn for-profit credit rating agencies into non-profit institutions  independent from Wall Street  No longer will Wall Street be able to pick and choose which credit agency will rate their products 
If we are going to create a financial system that works for all Americans  we have got to stop financial institutions from ripping off the American people by charging sky-high interest rates and outrageous fees 
In my view  it is unacceptable that Americans are paying a $4 or $5 fee each time they go to the ATM 
It is unacceptable that millions of Americans are paying credit card interest rates of 20 or 30 percent 
The Bible has a term for this practice  It's called usury  And in The Divine Comedy  Dante reserved a special place in the Seventh Circle of Hell for those who charged people usurious interest rates 
Today  we don't need the hellfire and the pitch forks  we don't need the rivers of boiling blood  but we do need a national usury law 
Today  we need to cap interest rates on credit cards and consumer loans at 15 percent 
In 1980  Congress passed legislation to require credit unions to cap interest rates on their loans at no more than 15 percent  And  that law has worked well  Unlike big banks  credit unions did not receive a huge bailout from the taxpayers of this country  It is time to extend this cap to every lender in America 
We must also cap ATM fees at $2 00  People should not have to pay a 10 percent fee for withdrawing $40 of their own money out of an ATM 
Big banks need to stop acting like loan sharks and start acting like responsible lenders 
We also need to give Americans affordable banking options 
The reality is that  unbelievably  millions of low-income Americans live in communities where there are no normal banking services  Today  if you live in a low-income community and you need to cash a check or get a loan to pay for a car repair or a medical emergency  where do you go 
You go to a payday lender who could charge an interest rate of over 300 percent and trap you into a vicious cycle of debt  That is unacceptable 
We need to stop payday lenders from ripping off millions of Americans  Post offices exist in almost every community in our country  One important way to provide decent banking opportunities for low income communities is to allow the U S  postal Service to engage in basic banking services  and that's what I will fight for 
Further  we need to structurally reform the Federal Reserve to make it a more democratic institution responsive to the needs of ordinary Americans  not just the billionaires on Wall Street 
When Wall Street was on the verge of collapse  the Federal Reserve acted with a fierce sense of urgency to save the financial system  We need the Fed to act with the same boldness to combat unemployment and low wages 
Further  we need to structurally reform the Federal Reserve to make it a more democratic institution responsive to the needs of ordinary Americans  not just the billionaires on Wall Street 
In my view  it is unacceptable that the Federal Reserve has been hijacked by the very bankers it is in charge of regulating  I think the American people would be shocked to learn that Jamie Dimon  the CEO of JP Morgan Chase  served on the board of the New York Fed at the same time that his bank received a $391 billion bailout from the Federal Reserve  That is a clear conflict of interest that I would ban as president  When I am elected  the foxes will no longer be guarding the henhouse at the Fed  Under my administration  banking industry executives will no longer be allowed to serve on the Fed's boards and handpick its members and staff 
Further  the Fed should stop paying financial institutions interest to keep money out of the economy and parked at the Fed  Incredibly  the excess reserves of financial institutions that are sitting in the Federal Reserve has grown from less than $2 billion in 2008 to $2 4 trillion today  That is absurd 
Instead of paying banks interest on these reserves  the Fed should charge them a fee that could be used to provide affordable loans to small businesses to create hundreds of thousands of jobs 
Finally  let me tell you what no other candidate will tell you  No president  not Bernie Sanders or anyone else  can effectively address the economic crises facing the working families of this country alone  The truth is that Wall Street  corporate America  the corporate media and wealthy campaign donors are just too powerful 
What this campaign is about is building a political movement which revitalizes American democracy  which brings millions of people together  black and white  Latino  Asian-American  Native American  young and old  men and women  gay and straight  native born and immigrant  people of all religions 
Yes  Wall Street has enormous economic and political power  Yes  Wall Street makes huge campaign contributions  they have thousands of lobbyists and they provide very generous speaking fees to those who go before them 
Yes  They have an endless supply of money  But we have something they don't have  And that is that when millions of working families stand together  demanding fundamental changes in our financial system  we have the power to bring about that change 
Yes  we can make our economy work for all Americans  not just a handful of wealthy speculators  And  now more than ever  that is exactly what we must do 
And so my message to you today is straightforward  If elected president  I will rein in Wall Street so they can't crash our economy again 
Will they like me  No  Will they begin to play by the rules if I'm president  You better believe it 
Thank you and I look forward to working with the most powerful force in our great nation  not the Barons of Wall Street but the people our government was created to serve  
How great it is to be with you tonight 
Let me begin by thanking the hundreds of thousands of Americans who actively participated in our campaign as volunteers  Let me thank the 2 1/2 million Americans who helped fund our campaign with an unprecedented 8 million individual campaign contributions  averaging $27 a piece  Let me thank the 13 million Americans who voted for the political revolution  giving us the 1 846 pledged delegates here tonight  46 percent of the total  And delegates  Thank you for being here  and for all the work you've done  I look forward to your votes during the roll call on Tuesday night 
And let me offer a special thanks to the people of my own state of Vermont who have sustained me and supported me as a mayor  congressman  senator and presidential candidate  And to my family  my wife Jane  four kids and seven grandchildren  thank you very much for your love and hard work on this campaign 
I understand that many people here in this convention hall and around the country are disappointed about the final results of the nominating process  I think it's fair to say that no one is more disappointed than I am  But to all of our supporters  here and around the country  I hope you take enormous pride in the historical accomplishments we have achieved 
Together  my friends  we have begun a political revolution to transform America and that revolution  our revolution  continues  Election days come and go  But the struggle of the people to create a government which represents all of us and not just the 1 percent  a government based on the principles of economic  social  racial and environmental justice  that struggle continues  And I look forward to being part of that struggle with you 
Let me be as clear as I can be  This election is not about  and has never been about  Hillary Clinton  or Donald Trump  or Bernie Sanders or any of the other candidates who sought the presidency  This election is not about political gossip  It's not about polls  It's not about campaign strategy  It's not about fundraising  It's not about all the things the media spends so much time discussing 
This election is about  and must be about  the needs of the American people and the kind of future we create for our children and grandchildren 
This election is about ending the 40-year decline of our middle class the reality that 47 million men  women and children live in poverty  It is about understanding that if we do not transform our economy  our younger generation will likely have a lower standard of living then their parents 
This election is about ending the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality that we currently experience  the worst it has been since 1928  It is not moral  not acceptable and not sustainable that the top one-tenth of one percent now own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent  or that the top 1 percent in recent years has earned 85 percent of all new income  That is unacceptable  That must change 
This election is about remembering where we were 7 1/2 years ago when President Obama came into office after eight years of Republican trickle-down economics 
The Republicans want us to forget that as a result of the greed  recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street  our economy was in the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression  Some 800 000 people a month were losing their jobs  We were running up a record-breaking deficit of $1 4 trillion and the world's financial system was on the verge of collapse 
We have come a long way in the last 7 1/2 years  and I thank President Obama and Vice President Biden for their leadership in pulling us out of that terrible recession 
Yes  we have made progress  but I think we can all agree that much  much more needs to be done 
This election is about which candidate understands the real problems facing this country and has offered real solutions  not just bombast  fear-mongering  name-calling and divisiveness 
We need leadership in this country which will improve the lives of working families  the children  the elderly  the sick and the poor  We need leadership which brings our people together and makes us stronger  not leadership which insults Latinos  Muslims  women  African-Americans and veterans  and divides us up 
By these measures  any objective observer will conclude that  based on her ideas and her leadership  Hillary Clinton must become the next president of the United States  The choice is not even close 
This election is about a single mom I saw in Nevada who  with tears in her eyes  told me that she was scared to death about the future because she and her young daughter were not making it on the $10 45 an hour she was earning  This election is about that woman and the millions of other workers in this country who are struggling to survive on totally inadequate wages 
Hillary Clinton understands that if someone in America works 40 hours a week  that person should not be living in poverty  She understands that we must raise the minimum wage to a living wage  And she is determined to create millions of new jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure  our roads  bridges  water systems and wastewater plants 
But her opponent  Donald Trump  well  he has a very different view  He does not support raising the federal minimum wage of $7 25 an hour  a starvation wage  While Donald Trump believes in huge tax breaks for billionaires  he believes that states should actually have the right to lower the minimum wage below $7 25  What an outrage!
This election is about overturning Citizens United  one of the worst Supreme Court decisions in the history of our country  That decision allows the wealthiest people in America  like the billionaire Koch brothers  to spend hundreds of millions of dollars buying elections and  in the process  undermine American democracy 
Hillary Clinton will nominate justices to the Supreme Court who are prepared to overturn Citizens United and end the movement toward oligarchy in this country  Her Supreme Court appointments will also defend a woman's right to choose  workers rights  the rights of the LGBT community  the needs of minorities and immigrants and the government's ability to protect the environment 
If you don't believe this election is important  if you think you can sit it out  take a moment to think about the Supreme Court justices that Donald Trump would nominate and what that would mean to civil liberties  equal rights and the future of our country 
This election is about the thousands of young people I have met who have left college deeply in debt  and the many others who cannot afford to go to college  During the primary campaign  Secretary Clinton and I both focused on this issue but with different approaches  Recently  however  we have come together on a proposal that will revolutionize higher education in America  It will guarantee that the children of any family this country with an annual income of $125 000 a year or less  83 percent of our population  will be able to go to a public college or university tuition free  That proposal also substantially reduces student debt 
This election is about climate change  the greatest environmental crisis facing our planet  and the need to leave this world in a way that is healthy and habitable for our kids and future generations  Hillary Clinton is listening to the scientists who tell us that  unless we act boldly and transform our energy system in the very near future  there will be more drought  more floods  more acidification of the oceans  more rising sea levels  She understands that when we do that we can create hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs 
Donald Trump  Well  like most Republicans  he chooses to reject science  He believes that climate change is a  hoax  no need to address it  Hillary Clinton understands that a president's job is to worry about future generations  not the short-term profits of the fossil fuel industry 
This campaign is about moving the United States toward universal health care and reducing the number of people who are uninsured or under-insured  Hillary Clinton wants to see that all Americans have the right to choose a public option in their health care exchange  She believes that anyone 55 years or older should be able to opt in to Medicare and she wants to see millions more Americans gain access to primary health care  dental care  mental health counseling and low-cost prescription drugs through a major expansion of community health centers 
And What is Donald Trump's position on health care  No surprise there  Same old  same old Republican contempt for working families  He wants to abolish the Affordable Care Act  throw 20 million people off of the health insurance they currently have and cut Medicaid for lower-income Americans 
Hillary Clinton also understands that millions of seniors  disabled vets and others are struggling with the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs and the fact that Americans pay the highest prices in the world for their medicine  She knows that Medicare must negotiate drug prices with the pharmaceutical industry and that drug companies should not be making billions in profits while one in five Americans are unable to afford the medicine they need  The greed of the drug companies must end 
This election is about the leadership we need to pass comprehensive immigration reform and repair a broken criminal justice system  It's about making sure that young people in this country are in good schools and at good jobs  not in jail cells  Hillary Clinton understands that we have to invest in education and jobs for our young people  not more jails or incarceration 
In these stressful times for our country  this election must be about bringing our people together  not dividing us up  While Donald Trump is busy insulting one group after another  Hillary Clinton understands that our diversity is one of our greatest strengths  Yes  We become stronger when black and white  Latino  Asian-American  Native American  all of us  stand together  Yes  We become stronger when men and women  young and old  gay and straight  native born and immigrant fight to create the kind of country we all know we can become 
It is no secret that Hillary Clinton and I disagree on a number of issues  That's what this campaign has been about  That's what democracy is about  But I am happy to tell you that at the Democratic Platform Committee there was a significant coming together between the two campaigns and we produced  by far  the most progressive platform in the history of the Democratic Party  Among many other strong provisions  the Democratic Party now calls for breaking up the major financial institutions on Wall Street and the passage of a 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act  It also calls for strong opposition to job-killing free trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership 
Our job now is to see that platform implemented by a Democratic Senate  a Democratic House and a Hillary Clinton presidency  and I am going to do everything I can to make that happen 
I have known Hillary Clinton for 25 years  I remember her as a great first lady who broke precedent in terms of the role that a first lady was supposed to play as she helped lead the fight for universal health care  I served with her in the United States Senate and know her as a fierce advocate for the rights of children 
Hillary Clinton will make an outstanding president and I am proud to stand with her here tonight 
Mr  President  let me begin by thanking my friend from Virginia for doing what is very important  I think the essence of what he is saying is that today there are millions of Federal employees  people in the Armed Forces  who are doing the very best they can  In many instances  they are doing a great job to protect our country  to keep it safe  And very often  to be honest with you  these folks get dumped on  So it is important that people such as Senator Warner come here and point out individuals who are doing a great job  people of whom we are very proud  So I thank Senator Warner for that  
Mr  President  as I think everyone knows  President Obama and the Republican leadership have reached an agreement on a very significant tax bill  In my view  the agreement they reached is a bad deal for the American people  I think we can do better  
I am here today to take a strong stand against this bill  and I intend to tell my colleagues and the Nation exactly why I am in opposition to this bill  You can call what I am doing today whatever you want  You can call it a filibuster  You can call it a very long speech  I am not here to set any great records or to make a spectacle; I am simply here today to take as long as I can to explain to the American people the fact that we have to do a lot better than this agreement provides  
Let me enumerate some of the reasons I am opposed to this agreement  
First  as everybody knows  this Nation has a recordbreaking $13 8 trillion national debt at the same time as the middle class is collapsing and poverty is increasing  And I think it is important to say a word because I am not necessarily sure a lot of Americans know this about how we got to where we are today in terms of the national debt  
I know there are some people who think this all began the day President Obama took office  Well  that is not quite the case  When President Clinton left office  this country was running  in fact  a very significant surplus  and the projections were that we were going to continue to run a surplus  During the 8 years of President Bush's administration  for a number of reasons the primary reasons being the war in Iraq  the war in Afghanistan  huge tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country  a Medicare Part D prescription drug program  the Wall Street bailout  among other things  all of which were not paid for we saw an almost doubling of the national debt  Since President Obama has been in office  we have passed a stimulus package which has also added to the deficit and national debt  
But here we are today with a $13 8 trillion national debt  a $1 4 trillion deficit  and almost all Americans are in agreement that this is a very serious issue  So the first point I would make is that it seems to me to be unconscionable unconscionable for my conservative friends and for everybody else in this country to be driving up this already too high national debt by giving tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires who don't need it  and in a number of cases they don't even want it  
Here is one of the interesting ironies  There are lists of many very wealthy people who have come forward and said  Sure  I want a tax break  Everybody wants a tax break  But you know what  there are other priorities in this country  and I don't need it  Two of the wealthiest people in the world and these are billionaires Bill Gates of Microsoft and Warren Buffett of Berkshire  say  It is absurd  We don't need a tax break  
All over the country  you hear a lot of folks who have a lot of money saying  Don't drive up the deficit and force our kids to pay higher taxes to pay off the national debt in order to give tax breaks to the richest people in this country  
We have been told not to worry too much because the extension of these tax breaks for the wealthy will only last 2 years not to worry  Maybe that is the case  But given the political reality I have seen in Washington  my guess is that 2 years from now these tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country will be extended again  What happens around here is that the argument will be made that if you end these tax breaks you are raising taxes  That is what we are hearing right now  I see no reason why  in the middle of a Presidential election  those arguments will not be made again and I see no reason not to believe that those tax breaks will be extended again  
(The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore assumed the chair ) 
Mr  SANDERS  Clearly  we have a number of Republicans who want to make that extension permanent  Whether it will ever be made permanent I don't know  But the point is  when you hear folks say it is only a 2-year extension  I suggest you take that with a grain of salt  
Let me say  if in fact we do what the Republicans have wanted to do right now as we enter this debate they wanted a 10-year extension that would add $700 billion to our national debt  I have four kids and I have six grandchildren  None of them has a whole lot of money  I think it is grossly unfair to ask my kids and grandchildren and the children all over this country to be paying higher taxes in order to provide tax breaks for billionaires because we have driven up the national debt  That is plain wrong  I think the vast majority of the American people  whether they are progressives like myself or whether they are conservatives  perceive that concept of giving tax breaks to billionaires when we have such a high national debt makes no sense at all  
Furthermore  it is important to point out that extending income tax breaks to the top 2 percent is not the only unfair tax proposal in this agreement  This agreement between the President and the Republican leadership also calls for a continuation of the Bush era 15-percent tax rate on capital gains and dividends  meaning that those people who make their living off their investments will continue to pay a substantially lower tax rate than firemen  teachers  nurses  carpenters  and virtually all the other working people of this country  I do not think that is fair  That is wrong  If this agreement were to be passed  we would be continuing that unfair arrangement  
On top of all that  this agreement includes a horrendous proposal regarding the estate tax  That is a Teddy Roosevelt initiative  Teddy Roosevelt was talking about this in the early years of the 20th century  It was enacted in 1916 and it was enacted for a couple of reasons  Teddy Roosevelt and the people of that era thought it was wrong that a handful of people could have a huge  concentration of wealth and then give that wealth  transmit that wealth to their children  He did not think that was right  
Furthermore  it was a source  a progressive and fair source  of revenue  Under the agreement struck between the Republican leadership and the President  the estate tax rate  which was 55 percent under President Clinton and let's all remember  we had problems with the economy under President Clinton but very few will deny that during those years we were creating a heck of a lot more jobs than we did under President Bush  That is the fact over 20 million jobs under President Clinton  We lost 600 000 private sector jobs under President Bush  During the Clinton era  the tax rate on the estate tax was 55 percent  What this arrangement would do is lower that tax rate to 35 percent  with an exemption on the first $5 million of an individual's estate and $10 million for couples  
Here is the important point I think many people do not know  I have to confess my Republican friends and their pollsters and their language people have done a very good job  This is the so-called death tax  I think all over America people say this is terrible  I have $50 000 in the bank and I want to leave that to my kids and the Government is going to take 55 percent of that  35 percent of that  What an outrage  
Let us be very clear  This tax applies only only to the top three-tenths of 1 percent of American families; 99 7 percent of American families will not pay one nickel in an estate tax  This is not a tax on the rich  this is a tax on the very  very  very rich  
If my Republican friends had been successful in doing what they want to do  which is eliminate this estate tax completely  it would have cost our Treasury raised the national debt by $1 trillion over a 10-year period  Families such as the Walton family  of Wal-Mart fame  would have received  just this one family  about a $30 billion tax break  
I find it hard to believe when we are talking about massive cuts in programs for working families  when we have this huge national debt  that anybody would be agreeing to lowering the estate tax rate to 35 percent  That is what this agreement does and I think that is a very bad idea  
Once again  while the agreement on the estate tax is for 2 years once again  there is very little doubt in my mind that the Republicans will continue to push for lower and lower estate tax rates because that is what they want  I think Senator Kyl has been pretty clear about this  They want to permanently repeal that tax  That is $1 trillion in tax breaks to the top three-tenths of 1 percent  I think we are down a bad path there and that is another reason why this agreement does not make a whole lot of sense  
Third and this is a very important point that I think has not yet gotten the attention it deserves this agreement contains a payroll tax holiday which would cut $120 billion from Social Security payroll taxes for workers  There are a lot of folks out there who say  This is pretty good  I am a worker  my contribution will go from 6 2 percent today down to 4 2 percent  I will have more money in my paycheck  It is a good idea  
Let's take a deep breath and let's think about it for a second and understand what this whole thing is about  This payroll tax holiday concept  as I understand it  originally started with conservative Republicans  I know the Vice President recently made the point this was originally a Republican idea  Why did the Republicans come up with this idea  These are exactly the same people who do not believe in Social Security  These are the same people who either want to make significant cuts in Social Security or else they want to privatize Social Security entirely  Here is the point  They understand that if we divert funding that is supposed to go into the Social Security trust fund  which is what this payroll tax holiday does  this is money that goes into the Social Security trust fund that is now being diverted  cut back  in order to provide financial support for workers but that is a lot of money not going into the trust fund  
What the President and others are saying is not to worry because that money will be covered by the general fund  That is a very bad and dangerous precedent  Up until now  what Social Security has been about is 100 percent funding from payroll contributions  not from the general tax base  Once again  this is a 1-year program  The loss of revenue going into Social Security can be covered by the general fund  But we have a $13 trillion national debt  How much longer will the general fund put money into Social Security  Is it a good idea for the general fund to be doing that  
I would argue this is not a good idea  This is a very dangerous step forward for those of us who believe in Social Security  But this is not just Bernie Sanders saying this  One of the more effective and I think important senior groups in America is called the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare  I don't know exactly how many but they have many members all over this country  I know they are active in the State of Vermont  I want to read to you from a press release they sent out the other day  This is the headline on it  from the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare  ``Cutting Contributions to Social Security Signals the Beginning of the End  Payroll Tax Holiday Is Anything But '' 
This is what they say  This comes from Barbara Kennelly  Barbara came from the House of Representatives  I have known her for years  She is now the president and CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare  one of the strong senior groups in the country  
Even though Social Security contributed nothing to the current economic crisis  it has been bartered in a deal that provides deficit-busting tax cuts for the wealthy  Diverting $120 billion in Social Security contributions for a so-called ``tax holiday'' may sound like a good deal for workers now  but it's bad business for the program that a majority of middle-class seniors will rely upon in the future  
That is what the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare says about that agreement and I agree with them  For all of us who understand that Social Security is life and death for tens of millions of Americans today and will be vitally important for working people as they reach retirement age  it is important that we understand that Social Security has done a great job  A few minutes ago the Presiding Officer was on the floor talking about the strong work that our Federal employees do  and he is absolutely right  Sometimes we also take for granted that Social Security has been an enormous success  It has done exactly what those people who created it have wanted it to do nothing more  nothing less  It has succeeded  It has taken millions of seniors out of poverty and given them an element of security  It has also helped people with disabilities maintain their dignity  Widows and orphans are also getting help  
For 75 years it has worked well  It has a $2 6 trillion surplus today and it can pay out benefits for the next 29 years  It is strong  We want to make it stronger  This payroll tax holiday I am afraid is a step very much in the wrong direction and that is one of the important reasons why this agreement between the President and the Republicans should be defeated  
Included in the agreement are a number of business tax cuts  I am not going to be here to say that some of them may not work  Some of them may work  Some will work better than others  There is a whole list of them  But this is what I will say  Economists on both ends of the political spectrum believe that if we are serious about addressing the horrendous economic crisis we are in now  9 8 percent unemployment  there are far more effective ways of creating the jobs we have to create than those tax proposals  With corporate America already sitting on close to $2 trillion cash on hand  it is not that our friends in corporate America don't have any money  we have to help them  They have $2 trillion cash on hand  The problem is not in my view that corporate taxes are too high; it is that the middle class simply doesn't have the money to purchase the goods and products that make our economy go and create jobs  
I think if our goal is to create the millions and millions of jobs we need  and if our goal is to make our country stronger internationally in a very tough global economy  I would much prefer  and I think most economists would agree with me that a better way to do that  to create the millions of jobs we have to create  is to invest heavily in our infrastructure  
The truth is and I don't think anyone disputes this  the infrastructure in the United States is crumbling  and I will go into more detail about that later  
I have some very good information on it  But you do not have to be a civil engineer to know that  All you have to do is get in your car today and drive someplace in my State and all over this country  What you are going to see are roads that are in disrepair  You are going to see bridges that  in some cases  have actually been shut down  You are going to see water systems I remember I was in Rutland  VT  the second or third largest city in the State of Vermont  and the mayor showed me a piece of pipe  an old piece of pipe  
He said  You know  the engineer who helped develop this water system and lay this pipe  after he did this work for Rutland  he went off to fight in the war  
I knew there was a catch line coming  I said  What war was it  
He said  It was the Civil War  
So you are talking about water pipe being in Rutland  VT and this is true all over the United States laid in the Civil War  The result is  we lose an enormous amount of clean water every day through leaks and water pipes bursting all over the United States of America  
Well  we can put people to work improving our water systems  our wastewater plants  It is a very expensive proposition to develop a good wastewater plant  I was a mayor  you were a Governor  Mr  President  It is an expensive proposition for roads  bridges  Furthermore  I do not have to tell anybody here  our rail system  which used to be the greatest rail system in the world  is now falling way behind every other major country on Earth  
As a result of the stimulus package  we did a whole lot of very good things in the State of Vermont  One of the things we were able to do was use $50 million of Federal funds and private money to make major repair on one of our important railways in the State  
But we remain far behind most other countries around the industrialized world  China is exploding in terms of the number of high-speed rail lines they have  We have to do better  Our airports need work  Our air controllers need to be updated in terms of the technology they have and use to make our flights safe  
The point is  what most economists would tell you is when you invest in infrastructure  you get a bigger bang for the buck  You create more jobs for your investment than  in most instances  giving a variety of tax breaks to the corporate world  
Second of all  and not unimportantly  when you invest in infrastructure  you are improving the future of this country  You are making us more productive  It is not just creating jobs  it is creating jobs for very specific purposes  which makes our Nation more productive and efficient  
Thirdly  let me tell you something  As a former mayor  infrastructure does not get better if you ignore it  You can turn your back  if you are a mayor or Governor  on the roads and the highways because you do not have the money to fix them today  but they are not going to get better next year  At some point  they are going to have to be repaired and fixed  We may as well do that right now  
So I believe the money  the very substantial sums of money in this agreement between the President and the Republicans  which goes into tax breaks for corporate America  could be effectively spent on infrastructure  
The fifth point I want to make in opposition to this agreement and what we have heard from the President and others is that this is a compromise  You cannot get everything you want  Well  you cannot get everything you want around here is true  but one of the examples of compromise is an extension of unemployment benefits for 13 months  
Well  let me be very clear  In the midst of a serious and major recession  at a time when millions of our fellow Americans are not only out of work through no fault of their own  but they have been out of work for a very long time  it would be  in my view  immoral and wrong to turn our backs on those workers  Their unemployment benefits are going to be running out soon  It is absolutely imperative that we extend those unemployment benefits for the 2 million workers who would lose them  
But here is the point I want to make  Some people say this is a compromise  Well  the Republicans gave on unemployment; the President gave on extending tax breaks for the rich  et cetera  But here is the point  I do not believe  honestly  that the Republican support now for extending unemployment benefits constitutes much of a compromise because the truth is  for the past 40 years  under both Democratic and Republican administrations  under the leadership in the Senate and the House of Democrats or Republicans  it has been bipartisan policy that whenever the unemployment rate has been above 7 2 percent  unemployment insurance has always been extended  So what we have had is longstanding  bipartisan policy  That is what we have always done  That is what we should be doing in the future  I do not regard Republicans now supporting what their party has always supported  extending unemployment benefits when unemployment becomes very high I do not see that as a compromise  I see that as what has been going on in this country and in the Senate for four decades  
I have talked about the negative aspects of this proposal  But I am going to be the first to admit that  of course  there are positive and good agreements in this  And what are they  What are some of the positive aspects of this agreement  Let me just tick them off  
No  1  I believe very strongly  and I know the President does  it is absolutely imperative that we extend middle-class tax cuts for 98 percent of the American people  I do not think there has been any debate about that  
When median family income has gone down by over $2 000 during the Bush years  when millions of our people today are working longer hours for low wages  when people cannot afford to send their kids to college or to take care of childcare  I think it makes absolute sense  I do not think anyone will argue it is absolutely imperative that we extend middle-class tax cuts  That is what this provision does  That is the right thing  
Furthermore  in this agreement we have an extension of the earned-income tax credit for working Americans  and the child and college tax credit are also in there  Every one of these agreements is very important  These programs will keep millions of Americans from slipping out of the middle class and into poverty  They will allow millions of Americans to send their kids to college  
So I am not here to say there is not anything of value in this agreement between the President and the Republicans  There are  and we have to fight to make sure all of those programs remain in the final package when it is passed when the final package is passed  But when we look at the overall agreement  we must put it in a broader context; that is  what will the passage of this legislation mean for the future of our country  
In that area  if you look at it in that context  I think the evidence is pretty strong it is not just a good agreement and not something that should be passed  The passage of this agreement would mean we would continue the Bush policy of trickle-down economics for at least 2 more years  That is not a good thing to do because  I think  as most Americans know  that philosophy  that economic approach  simply did not work  The evidence is quite overwhelming  I do not think there is much debate  when median family income during Bush's 8 years goes down by $2 200  when we end up losing over 600 000 private sector jobs  and all of the job growth was in the Federal level  I do not see how anybody would want to continue that philosophy  But that  in essence  is what will happen if this agreement is passed  
Now  I want to make another point about what happens if if  and I will do my best to prevent this from happening but what would happen if this agreement would pass  Does anybody seriously believe our Republican colleagues would then say  OK  well  we have an extension of tax breaks for the very richest people  We have lowered the tax rate on the estate tax  Those are good victories for millionaires and billionaires  We are going to go home now  We are not going to continue the fight  
I do not think so  We are already hearing sounds about where our Republican friends want to go  The President put together what I thought was a very poor deficit reduction commission  I thought the folks on it were not reflective of the American people  I thought there was very much a big business  corporate partiality there  
The initiatives that came out of that commission which  fortunately  did not get the 14 votes they needed suggest to me that those of us who are concerned about protecting the needs of the middle class and working families are going to have to push back pretty hard for what is coming down the pike  
I think what we will be seeing is if this proposal negotiated between the President and the Republicans is passed  what you will be seeing within a few months are folks coming on the floor of the Senate  and this is what they will say  You know what  The deficit is high  The national debt is too high  And  yes oh  yes we drove the national debt up by giving tax breaks to millionaires  That is the way it goes  But we are going to have to deal with our national debt  
The Republicans will tell you  Oh  we have a great plan to deal with it  We are giving tax breaks to millionaires  But now what we are going to have to do is start making deep cuts in Social Security  and that deficit reduction commission started paving the way for that  very substantial cuts in Social Security  
Maybe we will have to raise the retirement age in Social Security to 69 or 70  Maybe we will have to make cuts in Medicare  Maybe we will have to make cuts in Medicaid  I think we are beginning to see  in the State of Arizona now  what goes on when you make deep cuts in Medicaid  
In Arizona right now there are people who are in line who need transplants  who will die if they do not get transplants  as a result of legislation they passed there  They are saying to people  young people  Sorry  we cannot afford to give you a transplant  and you are going to have to die  
Well  is that what we are looking forward to saying all over America  I certainly will do everything I can to prevent that  
We are certainly going to see a tax on environmental protection  on education  Some of us believe if this country is going to prosper and succeed in the global economy  we have to have the best educational system in the world from childcare through college  
Right now  it is extremely difficult for middle-class families to send their kids to college  Does anyone have any doubt whatsoever that our Republican friends are not going to come back here and say  Oh  we cannot afford to raise Pell Grants as we have in recent years  We cannot afford to support working families who have their kids in childcare  Cut  Cut  Cut  
That is insanity  I am being honest about it  So I would suggest their argument is that we have a high deficit and a high national debt; that if we pass this agreement and the national debt goes higher  it only gives them more impetus to go forward to cut programs that benefit working families and the middle class  
Let me also say there is no doubt in my mind what many not all but many of my Republican colleagues want to do; that is  they want to move this country back into the 1920s when essentially we had an economic and political system which was controlled by big money interests; where working people and the middle class had no programs to sustain them when things got bad  when they got old  and when they got sick; when labor unions were very hard to come by because of antiworker legislation  That is what they want  They do not believe in things like the Environmental Protection Agency  They do not believe in things like Social Security  Medicare  Medicaid  Federal aid to education  That is the fight we will be waging  
I think to surrender on this issue is to simply say we are going to be waging fight after fight  starting within a couple of months  
President Obama has said he fought as hard as he could against the Republican tax breaks for the wealthy and for an extension in unemployment  Well  maybe  But the reality is that fight cannot simply be waged inside the Beltway  Our job is to appeal to the vast majority of the American people to stand up and to say  Wait a minute  I do not want to see our national debt explode  I do not want to see my kids and grandchildren paying higher taxes in order to give tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires  
The vast majority of the American people do not support that agreement in terms of giving tax breaks to the very rich  Our job is to rally those people  I would like very much to see the American people saying to our Republican colleagues and some Democratic colleagues  Excuse me  Don't force my kids to have a lower standard of living in order to give tax breaks to the richest people  
What the President and all of us should be doing is going out and saying to those people  Call the Members of the Senate  call the Members of the House and say  Excuse me  How about representing the middle class and working families  for a change  rather than the wealthiest people  That is what democracy is about  
This fight is not going to be won inside the beltway in a Senate debate  It is going to be won when the American people stand and say  Wait a second  We cannot continue to give tax breaks to people who are doing phenomenally well right now  We cannot give tax breaks to the rich when we already have the most unequal distribution of income of any major country on Earth  The top 1 percent earns 23 percent of all income in America  more than the bottom 50 percent  They don't need more tax breaks to be paid for by our kids and grandchildren  
The vast majority of people are behind us on this issue  but they have to make their voices heard to their Senators  to their Congressmen  When they do  I believe we can come forward with an agreement which protects the middle-class and working families and is not a boondoggle for the wealthiest people  
It is important to put the agreement the President struck with Republicans in a broader context  We can't just look at the agreement unto itself  We have to look at it within the context of what is going on in the country today  both economically and politically  I think I speak for millions of Americans  There is a war going on in this country  I am not referring to the war in Iraq or the war in Afghanistan  I am talking about a war being waged by some of the wealthiest and most powerful people against working families  against the disappearing and shrinking middle class of our country  The billionaires of America are on the warpath  They want more and more and more  That has everything to do with this agreement reached between Republicans and the President  
In 2007  the top 1 percent of all income earners made 23 5 percent of all income  Let me repeat that  The top 1 percent earned over 23 percent of all income; that is  more than the bottom 50 percent  One percent here; fifty percent here  But for the very wealthy  that is apparently not enough  The percentage of income going to the top 1 percent nearly tripled since the 1970s  All over this country people are angry  frustrated  It is true in Vermont  I am sure it is true in Virginia  It is true all over America  But one of the reasons people are angry and frustrated is they are working incredibly hard  In Vermont  I can tell my colleagues  there are people who don't work one job  two jobs; there are people working three jobs and four jobs  trying to cobble together an income in order to support their families  I suspect that goes on all across the country  While people are working harder and harder  in many cases their income is going down  The fact is  80 percent of all new income earned from 1980 to 2005 has gone to the top 1 percent  Let me repeat that because that is an important fact  It explains why the American people are feeling as angry as they are  They are working hard  but they are not going anyplace  In some cases  in many cases  their standard of living is actually going down  Eighty percent of all income in recent years has gone to the top 1 percent  The richer people become much richer  the middle class shrinks  Millions of Americans fall out of the middle class and into poverty  
That is not apparently enough for our friends at the top who have a religious ferocity in terms of greed  They need more  more  It is similar to an addiction  Fifty million is not enough  They need $100 million  One hundred million is not enough; they need 1 billion  One billion is not enough  I am not quite sure how much they need  When will it stop  
Today  in terms of wealth as opposed to income  the top 1 percent now owns more wealth than the bottom 90 percent  When we went to school  we used to read in the textbooks about Latin America  and they used to refer to some of the countries there as ``banana republics '' countries in which a handful of families controlled the economic and political life of the nation  I don't wish to upset the American people  but we are not all that far away from that reality today  The top 1 percent has seen a tripling of the percentage of income they earn  Since the 1970s  the top 1 percent owning 23 percent of all income  more than the bottom 50 percent  The top 1 percent now owns more wealth than the bottom 90 percent  That is not the foundation of a democratic society  That is the foundation for an oligarchic society  The rich get richer  The middle class shrinks  Poverty increases  Apparently  God is not good enough yet for some of the richest people  
I say ``some of the richest'' because there are a lot of folks with a lot of money who do love this country  they are not into greed  but there are some who are  More  more more  that is what they need  
For example this galls me and galls many of the people in this country the horrendous recession we are in right now  where millions and millions of people have lost their jobs  their savings  their homes  this recession was caused by the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street  These guys  through their greed  created the most severe economic recession since the Great Depression  The American people bailed them out  Now  2 years after the bailout  they are giving themselves more compensation than they ever have  They are saying to the American people  Sorry we caused this recession because of our greed  Sorry you are unemployed  Sorry you lost your house  But that is not all that important  What is important is that I  on Wall Street  continue to get millions of dollars in compensation and in bonuses  that I have big parties  How can I get by on one house  I need 5 houses  10 houses  I need three jet planes to take me all over the world  Sorry  We have the money  We have the power  We have the lobbyists here on Wall Street  Tough luck  That is the world  get used to it  
The rich get richer  The middle class shrinks  Not enough  not enough  The very rich seem to want more and more and more  and they are prepared to dismantle the existing political and social order in order to get it  So we have the economics and distribution of income and wealth as one thing  but then we must discuss politics  
What happened last year  as I think most Americans know  is the Supreme Court made a very strange decision  The Supreme Court decided that corporations are people and they have the right of free speech and the right without disclosure all of this is through the Citizens United Supreme Court decision to put as much money as they want into campaigns all over the country  In this last campaign  that is what we saw  Billionaires  in secret  pouring money into campaigns all over the country  Does that sound like democracy to anybody in America; that we have a handful of billionaires probably dividing up the country  I will put this amount in Virginia  California  wherever  
That is what they were able to do  The rich get richer  and they don't sit on this money  What they then do is use it to elect people who support them and to unelect people who oppose their agenda and they use their political power to get legislation passed which makes the wealthy even wealthier  
One of the manifestations of that is  in fact  the agreement reached between the President and the Republican leadership  The wealthy contribute huge sums of money into campaigns  The wealthy have all kinds of lobbyists around here through corporate America  What they are going to get out of this agreement are huge tax breaks that benefit themselves  That is not what we should be supporting  
We should understand this agreement is just the beginning of an assault on legislation and programs that have benefited the American people for 70 or 80 years  Mark my words  there will be an intensive effort to privatize Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid  Furthermore  it is part of the Republican agenda  They want to expand and it is not only Republicans here  some Democrats as well our disastrous trade policies so large companies can continue their efforts to outsource American jobs to China and other low-wage countries  Any objective analysis of our trade policies has shown it has been a grotesque failure for ordinary Americans  It is hard to calculate exactly  but I think it is fair to say we have lost millions of decent-paying jobs  During the Bush years alone  some 48 000 factories shut down  We went from 19 million manufacturing jobs to 12 million manufacturing jobs  Historically  in this country  manufacturing jobs were the backbone of the working class  That is how people made it into the middle class  That is how they had decent health care benefits and pensions  Every day we are seeing those jobs disappear because corporate America would prefer to do business in China or other low-wage countries  
I returned from a trip to Vietnam last year  a beautiful country  People there work for 25  30 cents an hour  Sometimes when you go to a store  you may see a shirt made in Bangladesh  That shirt  in all likelihood  is made by a young girl who came in from the countryside to one of the factories there  The good news is that in Bangladesh  the minimum wage was doubled  It went from 11 cents an hour to 23 cents an hour  
Are American workers going to be able to compete against desperate people who make 23 cents an hour  
So my view and I think it reflects the views of the American people is that of course we want to see the people of Bangladesh and the people of China do well  But they do not have to do well at the expense of the American middle class  We do not have to engage in a race to the bottom  Our goal is to bring them up  not us down  But one of the results of our disastrous trade policies is that in many instances wages in the United States have gone down  
I believe in the coming months you are going to see an intensification of efforts to expand unfettered free trade  I think that will be a continuation of a disastrous policy for American workers  
Let me personalize this a little bit  This gentleman  shown in this picture I have in the Chamber I have no personal animus toward him at all; I think I met him once in a large room  His name is James Dimon  He is the CEO of JPMorgan Chase  Over the past 5 years  Mr  Dimon  who is the CEO of JPMorgan Chase  received $89 million in total compensation a bank that we now know received hundreds of billions in low-interest loans and other financial assistance from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department  
So Mr  Dimon received $89 million in total compensation  His bank was bailed out big time by the taxpayers  But under the legislation the President negotiated with the Republicans  Mr  Dimon I use him just as one example for thousands; nothing personal to Mr  Dimon will receive $1 1 million in tax breaks  So $1 1 million in tax breaks for a major CEO on Wall Street  who over the last 5 years received $89 million in total compensation  
Meanwhile just to contrast what is going on here 2 days ago  I brought before the Senate legislation which would provide a $250 one-time check to over 50 million seniors and disabled veterans  who for the last 2 years have not received a COLA on their Social Security  Many of those seniors and disabled vets are trying to get by on $14 000  $15 000  $18 000 a year  The total package for that bill was approximately $14 billion that would go out to over 50 million seniors and disabled vets  We won that vote on the floor of the Senate 53 to 45  But just because you get 53 votes in the Senate does not mean you win  Because the Republicans filibustered  I needed 60 votes  I could not get 60 votes  I could not get one Republican vote to provide a $250 check to a disabled veteran trying to get by on $15 000 or $16 000 a year  
But Mr  Dimon  who made $89 million in the last 5 years  will get a $1 million tax deduction if this agreement is passed  Now  that may make sense to some people  It does not make a lot of sense to me  
Again  I have no particular knowledge  animus I do not know if I ever met John Mack in my life  He is the CEO of Morgan Stanley  In 2006  he received a $40 million bonus  which at the time was the largest bonus ever given to a Wall Street executive  
Two years after receiving this bonus  Morgan Stanley received some $2 trillion in low-interest loans and billions from the Treasury Department  Instead of losing his job  under this agreement  Mr  Mack will be receiving an estimated $926 000 tax break next year  Congratulations  Mr  Mack  You are doing fine  We could not get $250 for a disabled vet  
Over the past 5 years  Ken Lewis  the former CEO of Bank of America  received over $165 million in total compensation  In 2008  Bank of America received hundreds of billions in taxpayer-backed loans from the Fed and a $45 billion bailout from the Treasury Department  
What will Mr  Lewis receive if the agreement negotiated between the President and the Republicans goes forth  He will get a $713 000 tax cut  
And on and on it goes  I did not mean to specifically pick on these guys  Some of the wealthiest people in the country will be receiving a million-dollar-plus tax break  So we as a nation have to decide whether that makes a lot of sense  I think it does not  
Let me mention that a couple weeks ago the Fed  the Federal Reserve  published on their Web site some 21 000 transactions that took place during the Wall Street meltdown period  That disclosure was made possible as part of a provision that I put into the financial reform bill because I thought it was important the American people  for the first time  lift the veil of secrecy at the Fed and get a sense of the kind of money that was lent out by the Fed and who received that money  
What is very interesting is that the American people and the media have focused on the $700 billion Wall Street bailout now known as TARP  I happen to have voted against that agreement  but  in fairness  that agreement was pretty transparent  The Treasury Department put up on their Web site all of those banks and financial institutions that received the money  If you want to know where the money went  it is right up there on the Treasury Department's Web site  
But at the same time  a bigger transaction than TARP was taking place  which got relatively little attention  and that was the role the Fed was playing in terms of the Wall Street bailout  
While the TARP issue was being debated during that period  Ben Bernanke  the Chairman of the Federal Reserve  Tim Geithner  who was then the president of the New York Fed  and a handful of other very powerful people were sitting behind closed doors getting ready to lend out trillions underline trillions of taxpayer dollars to large financial institutions and corporations  with no debate going on in Congress  no debate whatsoever  
On March 3  2009 and I am a member of the Senate Budget Committee I asked the Fed Chairman  Mr  Bernanke  to tell the American people the names of the financial institutions that received this unprecedented backdoor bailout from the Fed  how much they received  and the exact terms of this assistance  I will never forget that  I asked Mr  Bernanke for that information  He said  Senator  no  not going to give it to you  not going to make it public  
Well  on that day  I introduced legislation to make that information public  working with a number of Members of the House and the Senate  Some strange bedfellows conservatives and progressives came together on this issue  We managed to get in the Wall Street reform bill a disclosure provision  and on December 1 last week that information was made public  Let me talk a little bit about what was in that information made public by the Fed  
After years of stonewalling  the American people have learned the incredible  jaw-dropping details of the Fed's multimillion-dollar bailout of Wall Street and corporate America not just Wall Street  It is one of the things we learned  As a result of this disclosure  in my view we are going to get into what was in what we learned Congress has to take a very extensive look at all aspects of how the Federal Reserve functions and how we can make our financial institutions more responsive to the needs of ordinary Americans and small businesses  
What have we learned from the disclosure of December 1  This is based on an examination of over 21 000 separate Federal Reserve transactions  More work  more research needs to be done  But this is what we have learned so far  
As it turns out  while small business owners in the State of Vermont and throughout this country were being turned down for loans  not only did large financial institutions and I am talking about every major financial institution receive substantial help from the Fed  but also some of the largest corporations in this country not financial institutions also received help in terms of very low interest loans  
So you have every major financial institution  you have some of our largest private corporations  but here is something we also learned  and that is that this bailout impacted not just American banks and corporations but also foreign banks and foreign corporations as well  to the tune of many billions of dollars  
Then  on top of that  a number of the wealthiest individuals in this country also received a major bailout from the Fed  The ``emergency response '' which is what the Fed described their action as during the Wall Street collapse  appears to any objective observer to have been the clearest case that I can imagine of socialism for the very rich and rugged free market capitalism for everybody else  
In other words  if you are a huge financial institution  whose recklessness and greed caused this great recession  no problem  You are going to receive a substantial amount of help from the taxpayers of this country  If you are a major American corporation  such as General Electric or McDonald's or Caterpillar or Harley-Davidson or Verizon  no problem  You are going to receive a major handout from the U S  Government  
But if you are a small business in Vermont or California or Virginia  well  guess what  you are on your own because right now we know one of the real impediments to the kind of job creation we need in this country is that small businesses are not getting the loans they need  
Furthermore  what we now know is the extent of the bailout for the large financial corporations  Goldman Sachs received nearly $600 billion  Morgan Stanley received nearly $2 trillion  Citigroup received $1 8 trillion  Bear Stearns received nearly $1 trillion  And Merrill Lynch received some $1 5 trillion in short-term loans from the Fed  
But I think what is most surprising for the American people is not just the bailout of Wall Street and the financial institutions  and the bailout of large American corporations such as General Electric  but I think the American people would find it very strange that at a time when the American automobile sector was on the verge of collapse and goodness only knows how many thousands and thousands of jobs we have lost in automobile manufacturing in this country the Federal Reserve was also bailing out Toyota and Mitsubishi  two Japanese carmakers  by purchasing nearly $5 billion worth of their commercial paper from November 5  2008  through January 30  2009  
While virtually no American-made cars or products of any kind are bought in Japan  I think the American people would be shocked to learn that the Fed extended over $380 billion to the Central Bank of Japan to bail out banks in that country  
Furthermore  I think the American people are interested to know that the Fed bailed out the Korea Development Bank  the wholly owned  state-owned Bank of South Korea  by purchasing over $2 billion of its commercial paper  The sole purpose of the Korea Development Bank is to finance and manage major industrial projects to enhance the national economy not of the United States of America but of South Korea  I am not against South Korea  I wish the South Koreans all the luck in the world  But it should not be the taxpayers of the United States lending their banks' money to create jobs in South Korea  I would suggest maybe we want to create jobs in the United States of America  At the same time  the Fed also extended over $40 billion for the Central Bank of South Korea so that it had enough money to bail out its own banks  
At a time when small businesses in Vermont and all over this country cannot get the loans they need to expand their businesses  I think the American people would find it extremely I don't know what the word is maybe amusing that the Fed bailed out the state-owned Bank of Bavaria not Pennsylvania  not California  but Bavaria by purchasing over $2 2 billion of its commercial paper  
Furthermore  when we cannot get support on the floor of this Senate to extend unemployment benefits to millions of Americans who are on the verge of seeing them expire  I think the American people would find it incomprehensible that the Fed chose to bail out the Arab Banking Corporation based in Bahrain by providing them with over $23 billion in loans with an interest rate as low as one-quarter of 1 percent  So small businessmen all over America  Maybe you have to run to Bahrain and work with the Arab Banking Corporation there to get some pretty good loans  But it would be nice if maybe the Fed would start to pay attention to banks in this country  
Furthermore  the Fed extended over $9 6 billion to the Central Bank of Mexico  
What is interesting about all of this is that we had a very vigorous debate here in the Senate and in the House over the $700 billion TARP program  Every person in America could turn on C-SPAN and hear that debate  They could hear what President Bush had to say  hear what then-Senator Obama and Senator McCain had to say  It was all pretty public  But what took place at the Fed  which  in fact  amounted to a larger bailout  was done behind closed doors  Over $3 trillion was lent with zero transparency  In fact  as a result of this recent disclosure this is the first time we have gotten a glimpse of the magnitude and the particulars  the specificities of where that money was lent  and I think this is not a good thing for this country  Again  I voted against the bailout of Wall Street  but the debate was open and public  People wrote to their Senators and called their Senators  That is called democracy  After the TARP bailout took place  all of the loans were put up on the Web site  Transparency the American people knew who got the money  But the actions of the Fed were done behind closed doors  and  in my view it is an issue we are studying right now I think there were significant conflicts of interest  I think we had people sitting there at the New York Fed who were beneficiaries of this bailout  and that is an issue we need to explore  I should tell my colleagues that as part of the provision we got into the financial reform bill  the GAO is  in fact  doing just that investigating possible conflicts of interest at the Fed with regard to this bailout  
I think the question the American people are asking as they read about what the Fed did during the financial crisis is whether the Fed has now become the central bank of the world without any debate on the floor of the Senate or the Congress and without the knowledge of the American people  I think that is wrong  So I hope  out of this effort in bringing disclosure and transparency to the Fed  that one of the things that will come will be more transparency at the Fed  
As I indicated a moment ago  the Fed said this bailout was necessary in order to prevent the world economy from going over a cliff  But 3 years after the start of the recession  millions of Americans remain unemployed and have lost their homes  their life savings  and their ability to send their kids to college  Meanwhile  huge banks and large corporations have returned to making incredible profits and paying their executives recordbreaking compensation packages  as if the financial crisis they started never occurred  
What this recent disclosure tells us  among many other things  is that despite this huge taxpayer bailout  the Fed did not make the appropriate demands on these financial institutions which would have been necessary to rebuild our economy and protect the needs of ordinary Americans  In other words  what they simply did was give out billions and billions of dollars which were used in the self-interests of these financial institutions rather than saying  The American people who are hurting are bailing you out  and now that they have bailed you out  your responsibility is to do what you can to create jobs and to improve the standard of living of the people  many of whose lives you have severely impacted  
Let me give a few examples of what could have been done and what should be done  At a time when big banks have nearly $1 trillion in excess reserves parked at the Fed  the Fed has not required these institutions to increase lending to small and medium-sized businesses as a condition of the bailout  In other words  instead of the Fed just giving money to these financial institutions  the Fed should have said  We are giving you this money in order to get it into the economy  Start providing affordable loans to small businesses  
At a time when large corporations are more profitable than ever  the Fed did not demand that corporations that received this backdoor bailout create jobs and expand the economy once they returned to profitability  So what is going on in America  Unemployment is officially at 9 8 percent and in a real sense probably at 15 or 16 percent  but Wall Street is now doing fine  
A few years ago  Wall Street earned some 40 percent of all profits in America  and they are doing great  But what the Fed should have done and should do now is to tell Wall Street  You are part of the economy  You are not an isolated area just living for yourselves  You have to be a part of the productive economy  You have to lend money to small businesses to start creating jobs  
My office intends to investigate whether these secret Fed loans  in some cases  turned out to be direct corporate welfare to big banks that may have used those loans not to reinvest in the economy but  rather  to lend back to the Federal Government at a higher rate of interest by purchasing Treasury securities  Now  we don't know that  Maybe that is true  maybe it is not true  but we will take a look at it  In other words  did the Fed give one-half of 1 percent loans to a bank and that bank then purchased a Treasury security at 2 or 3 percent  If so  you have a 2-percent profit margin  and that is nothing but corporate welfare  The goal of the bailout was not to make Wall Street richer; the goal was to expand our economy and put people to work  
Furthermore  we know that as part of the TARP agreement  there was an effort to say to the financial institutions  We are not bailing you out in order for you to get huge compensation packages  We are not going to give you Federal money so you can make all kinds of money  We put limitations on executive compensation  
Did the Fed play the role of allowing some of the large financial institutions to pay back the TARP money  use the Fed money  and then continue with their very high executive compensation  We don't know  but it is worth investigating  
Furthermore and this is an issue I have worked on for a number of years  We know every major religion on Earth Christianity  Judaism  Islam  you name it has always felt that usury is immoral  What we mean by usury is that when someone doesn't have a lot of money and you loan them money  you don't get blood out of a stone  You can't ask for outrageously high interest rates when somebody is hurting  That is immoral  Every major religion  all great philosophers have written about this  Yet today we have millions of people in our country and I hear from Vermonters every week on this issue who are paying 25 percent or 30 percent and in some cases even higher interest rates on their credit cards 20 percent  30 percent interest rates  That is getting blood out of a stone  Yet many of the credit card companies were bailed out by the taxpayers of this country  What the Fed must do is say to those companies  Sorry  you can't continue to rip off the American people and charge them 25 percent or 30 percent interest rates  
As it happens  the four largest banks in this country  which are Bank of America  JPMorgan Chase  Wells Fargo  and Citigroup  issue half of all mortgages in this country  Four huge financial institutions issue half of all mortgages in this country  That unto itself is a huge problem  They issue half of all mortgages  two-thirds of all credit cards  That speaks to another issue about the need to start bringing up these financial institutions  But when you have a handful of banks that received huge bailouts from the Federal Government that are issuing two-thirds of the credit cards in this country  it seems to me to be somewhat absurd that the Fed did not say to them  Sorry  you can't charge people 25 or 30 percent interest rates on your credit cards  The same principle applies to mortgages  I don't have to tell anybody in this country that we have seen millions of folks lose their homes through foreclosure  and once again we see that the four largest banks in this country Bank of America  JPMorgan Chase  Wells Fargo  and Citigroup issue half of all mortgages  Four banks issue two-thirds of the credit cards and half of the mortgages  We bail these financial institutions out  Don't they have some responsibility to the American people  How many more Americans could have remained in their homes if the Fed had required those bailed-out banks to reduce mortgage payments as a condition of receiving these secret loans  
In terms of the interest rates on credit cards  a lot of people don't know this  but right now the banks are able to charge as much as they want to charge  but  in fact  credit unions are not  
Right now  we are looking at a situation where over one-quarter of all credit cardholders in this country are now paying interest rates above 20 percent and in some cases as high as 79 percent  In my view  when credit card companies charge over 20 percent interest  they are not engaged in the business of making credit available to their customers; they are involved in extortion and loan-sharking nothing essentially different than gangsters who charge outrageously high prices for their loans and who break kneecaps when their victims can't afford to pay them  So that is where we are right now  
I get calls and I am sure every other Senator gets calls from constituents who are very upset  They are going deeper and deeper into debt because they can't pay 25 or 30 percent interest rates on their credit cards  We bailed out the credit card companies  There was no provision that said  Stop ripping off the American people  Stop these companies from committing usury  
We are working on legislation that would say to these private banks not to charge any more money for the credit they provide than do the credit unions  It is going to be a tough fight because the lobbyists from Wall Street are all over this place  Wall Street spends huge amounts of money in campaign contributions  and it is going to be tough  But I think we need to pass that  I think the Fed needs to be much more active  in terms of what kinds of interest rates credit card companies should be paying  
Today  I am going to focus a lot  obviously  on an agreement reached between the President and the Republican leadership  which I think does not serve the American people well  One of the areas  as I mentioned earlier  where I think we could do a lot better in addressing the crisis of high unemployment in this Nation is by investing the kinds of money we need in our infrastructure  
According to the American Society of Civil Engineers  they graded America's roads  public transit  and aviation with a D  They said we must invest $2 2 trillion over the next 5 years simply to get a passable grade  Unfortunately  in the agreement struck between the President and the Republican leadership  to the best of my knowledge  not one nickel is going into investing in our infrastructure  
Let me tell you why we need to invest in infrastructure  A  that is where you can create the millions of jobs we desperately need in order to get us out of this recession  Second of all  we need to invest in infrastructure because  if we don't  we will become less and less competitive internationally  
According to the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission  $225 billion is needed annually for the next 50 years to upgrade our surface transportation system to a state of good repair and create a more advanced system  The Federal Highway Administration reports that $130 billion must be invested annually for a 20-year period to improve our bridges and the operational performance of our highways  At present  one in four of the Nation's bridges is either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete  One in four of our bridges is either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete  Yet in this agreement struck by the President and the Republican leadership  to the best of my knowledge  not one nickel is going into our infrastructure  We need to invest in our infrastructure  We need to improve our infrastructure  When we do that  we can create millions of jobs  
The Federal Transit Administration says $22 billion must be invested annually for a 20-year period to improve conditions and performances for our major transit systems  In Vermont  the situation is no different than in the rest of the country  Thirty-five percent of Vermont's 2 700 bridges nearly 1 000 bridges are functionally obsolete  In recent years  we have had to shut down bridges  which caused a lot of inconvenience to people who live in those areas  to workers who had to get to work using a bridge  Nearly half the bridges in Vermont have structural deficiencies  Rural transit options are few and far between  making rural  low-income Vermonters especially vulnerable to spikes in gas prices  In other words  in Vermont  and in other areas of rural America  you have one choice in the vast majority of cases as to how you get to work  That one choice is that you get in your car  you pay $3 for a gallon of gas  and that is it  That is because rural transportation in this country is very weak  
We can create jobs building the buses and vans we need  making it easier and cheaper for workers in rural America to get to work  In urban areas  it is no different  Transit systems in Chicago  New York  and even here in Washington  DC  are in disrepair  Let's improve and repair them  That makes us more efficient  more productive  and more competitive  and it creates jobs now  Not one nickel  as far as I can understand  has been invested in our infrastructure in this agreement  
The United States invests just 2 4 percent of GDP in infrastructure; whereas  Europe invests twice that amount  
Here is something I think every American should be keenly aware of and very worried about  I don't have to tell anybody that the Chinese economy is exploding every single day in almost every way  In China  they are investing almost four times our rate or 9 percent of their GDP annually in their infrastructure  Years ago  I was in Shanghai  China  I was coming from the airport to downtown as part of a congressional delegation  While we were on the bus coming in  my wife noticed something  She said  What was that  There was a blur that went by the window  Of course  I didn't notice it; she did  It turned out that blur was an experimental train they were working on high-speed rail  which is now operational there  and other similar prototypes are being developed in China  Here we are  the United States of America  which for so many years led the world in so many ways  and now you are seeing a newly developing country such as China with high-speed rail all over their country  making them more productive and efficient  and in our cities  our subways are breaking down  Amtrak is going 50  60 miles an hour  and the Chinese and Europeans have trains going hundreds of miles an hour  
This is the United States of America  Maybe I am old-fashioned  I think we can do it too  I think we can rebuild our rail system  make our country more efficient and create jobs  
China invested $186 billion in rail from 2006 to 2009  and according to the New York Times  within 2 years  they will open 42 new high-speed rail lines  with trains reaching speeds of 200 miles an hour  That is China  So I think if China can do it  the United States of America can do it  That is the way to rebuild America  make us stronger and create jobs  
By 2020  China plans to add 26 000 additional miles of tracks for freight and travel  as well as 230 000 miles of new or improved roads  and 97 new airports 97 new airports  Does anybody in America have the same problem I have when you go to the airport  where you are waiting in line and you have to deal with all the problems of older airports  China is building 97 new ones  We are not  If we are going to be effective in the international economy  and if our kids will have decent jobs  it is high time we woke up and began investing in our infrastructure  So that is not only to improve the long-term strength of America  our economic prowess  but it is also to create jobs right now that we desperately need  
Unfortunately  in this bill  this tax agreement between the President and the Republican leadership  there are many billions of dollars going into tax breaks for corporations  But there is not a whole lot of money in fact  zero dollars going into rebuilding our infrastructure  
Similarly and I know there has been debate since yesterday on this issue  There may be a small breakthrough  I don't have to tell Americans  least of all the people in Vermont  about what happens when the weather gets cold and you are forced to pay very high prices for heating oil  The time is long overdue for us to make the investments we need to transform our energy system away from coal  away from oil  We are spending as a nation and everybody in America has to appreciate this $350 billion every single year $1 billion a day  roughly importing oil from Saudi Arabia and other foreign countries  in order to make our economy go and in order to keep people warm  
Let me be very clear  The royal family of Saudi Arabia  which is our major source of oil  is doing just fine  Don't worry about the royal family of Saudi Arabia  They have zillions and zillions of dollars  Maybe it is a good idea that we seek energy independence  that we break our dependence on fossil fuel  and become more energy efficient  which  by the way  investing in public transportation certainly will do  and we move to sustainable energy  such as wind  solar  geothermal  and biomass  Guess what  China is doing that  Many of the solar panels coming into this country are not made in the United States but are made in China  They are big into wind turbines  I think the time is now for us to rebuild our infrastructure and create the jobs we desperately need  
Again  unfortunately  despite the enormous infrastructure needs we have in this country  this agreement  signed by the President and the Republican leadership  does not do that  When we talk about transforming our energy system and moving away from fossil fuel and making our homes more energy efficient and building solar panels  moving toward solar thermal power  in the Southwest of this country New Mexico  Arizona  Nevada we have some of the best solar exposure in the entire world  There are estimates that just in the Southwest of this country  on Federal land  we can provide 30 percent of the electricity American homes need  if we move toward solar thermal  We need to invest in our transmission lines  
What we are talking about is massive investment to create jobs  make us energy independent  clean up the environment  and deal with the huge amount of greenhouse gas emissions which are contributing to global warming  That is a win-win-win situation  Yet we are not seeing that in this bill  
I wish to tell you something  Mr  President  I will get into this at greater length later  When we talk about our good friends in the oil industry and I am not here to make a long speech about BP and what they have done in Louisiana  et cetera  I want everybody to know this  I will get into this at greater length later  Last year  our friends at ExxonMobil and ExxonMobil has historically been the most profitable corporation in the history of the world  Last year  ExxonMobil had  for them  a very bad year  They only made $19 billion in profit  Based on $19 billion  you might be surprised to know ExxonMobil not only paid nothing in taxes  they got a $156 million return from the IRS  How is that  For those of you who are working in an office  working in a factory  earning your $30 000  $40 000  $50 000  $60 000 a year  you pay taxes  
But if you are ExxonMobil  and you made $19 billion in profits last year  not only did you not pay any taxes this year  you got $156 million in return  
It is not just the large oil companies that do not pay their fair share of taxes  I am going to get into this a little bit later  but when we try to understand why we have such a huge national debt and a $1 3 or $1 4 trillion deficit  it is also important to understand that many large and profitable corporations avoid virtually all of their tax responsibility  
In August 2008  the General Accountability Office issued a report  According to this report  two out of every three corporations in the United States paid no Federal income taxes between 1998 and 2005  We have a $13 7 trillion national debt  and according to a GAO report published in August of 2008 two out of every three corporations in the United States paid no Federal income taxes between 1998 and 2005  Amazingly  these corporations had a combined $2 5 trillion in sales but paid no income taxes to the IRS  
Furthermore  according to a report from Citizens For Tax Justice  82 Fortune 500 companies in America I guess that is 82 out of 500 paid zero or less in Federal income taxes in at least 1 year from 2001 to 2003  That is a report from Citizens For Tax Justice  And the Citizens For Tax Justice report goes on to say  
In the years they paid no income tax  these companies earned $102 billion in U S  profits  But instead of paying $35 6 billion in income taxes  as the statutory 35 percent corporate tax rate seems to require  these companies generated so many excess tax breaks that they received outright tax rebate checks from the U S  Treasury totaling $12 6 billion  
That is from the Citizens For Tax Justice report  
So when we take a comprehensive look at what is going on in this country  why we have a $13 7 trillion national debt  it is terribly important to understand that while the middle class pays its share of taxes  there are many large corporations that not only are paying nothing in taxes  they are getting rebates from the Federal Government  
I will go into greater length later on  but as a member of the Budget Committee I can tell you we discuss quite often how every single year every single year corporate interests and wealthy individuals stash away huge amounts of money in tax savings in the Cayman Islands  Bermuda  and other countries in order to avoid paying their taxes in the United States of America  These are American corporations turning their back on the American people  saying as Mrs  Helmsley said so many years ago  many of you remember only small people pay taxes  Only the working stiffs out there pay taxes  
If you are a large corporation and you have a good lawyer or a good accountant  you know what to do  You invest your money in the Cayman Islands and in Bermuda  and you don't have to pay American taxes  But  by the way  as the disclosure report last week indicated  no problem; you get bailed out  When things get bad  you will be bailed out by the American taxpayers  On and on and on it goes  The rich and large corporations get richer  the CEOs earn huge compensation packages  and when things get bad  don't worry; Uncle Sam and the American taxpayers are here to bail you out  But when you are in trouble  well  we just can't afford to help you  if you are in the working class or the middle class of this country  
I want to return for a moment to the agreement that the President and the Republican leadership negotiated because I think that is the issue that all of America is now talking about  The President and the Republican leadership say it is a good deal  Democrats in the House yesterday said  Wait a second  It doesn't look to us like it is a good deal  In fact  we don't even want to bring it up on the floor of the House  In the Senate  I can tell you there are a number of us I don't know how many who say  Wait a minute  This is not a good deal for the middle class  it is not a good deal for our kids  and it is not a good deal for our workers  We can negotiate a better deal  The reason we are trying to delay passage of this agreement and I hope very much it doesn't have the votes here is we want the American people to stand and say  Wait a second  it makes no sense to us to be giving huge tax breaks to the richest people in this country literally millionaires and billionaires and driving up the national debt so our kids can pay more in taxes in order to pay off that debt  
This is a transfer of wealth  It is Robin Hood in reverse  We are taking from the middle class and working families and we are giving it to the wealthiest people in this country  I believe the agreement struck between the President and the Republican leadership is a bad deal  There may be some good parts to it  but  by and large  it is not a good deal  We can do better  and the American people must stand up and work with us  They must get on their phones and call their Senators and call their Congress men and women  They must make their voices heard and say  Enough is enough  The rich have it all right now the top 1 percent earns 23 1/2 percent of all income  more than the bottom 50 percent and it is absurd that we continue to bail out people who do not need any help and who are doing just fine  
I am here to take a stand against this bill  and I am going to do everything I can to defeat this bill  I am going to tell my colleagues and the American people exactly why  in my view  this is not good legislation  Let me just tick off some of the reasons I think this bill does not serve the best interests of the disappearing middle class of this country  
I don't know what kind of telephone calls the Presiding Officer is receiving from Colorado  but I can tell you that in the last 3 days alone  according to my front desk staff both here in Washington and in Vermont  we are over 5 000 telephone calls and e-mails  and I believe well over 98 percent of those messages are against this agreement  I don't know to what degree that is indicative of what is going on all over this country  but I suspect it is not radically different in other States  I think the American people are saying  with a $13 8 trillion national debt  let's not give tax breaks to billionaires and drive up that national debt  forcing our kids to pay more in taxes  and at the same time have Republicans coming forward to start slashing Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security because of this large debt that we are making larger  
I appeal to my conservative friends  I am not a conservative  but many conservatives have spent their entire political careers saying we cannot afford to drive up the national debt  that it is unsustainable  I agree with that  So vote against this agreement because it is driving up the national debt  In a significant way it is doing that by giving tax breaks to people who absolutely don't need it  
Once again  for those people who are earning $1 million a year or more  on average on average they will be getting a $100 000-a-year tax break  and for people earning $100 million a year  that number will be a lot higher  Who believes that makes any sense at all  
Let me give some other reasons I think this agreement is a bad agreement  The President says  Well  yes  we are going to extend tax breaks for all  including the top 2 percent  But don't worry  it is only going to be for 2 years not to worry  it is only going to be for 2 years  
Well  maybe that will be the case  But you know what  I doubt that very much  I have been in Congress long enough to know if you extend a tax break  it is very hard to undo that extension because if we can't tell our Republican colleagues that it is absurd to continue giving tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires if we can't do it now what makes you think we will do it in the midst of a Presidential election  
I say that as somebody who admires and likes the President  The President is a friend of mine  But his credibility has been severely damaged  If he is going to go forward  and if he is the Democratic nominee  I suspect he will say  Yes  I extended it for 2 years against my will; but  don't worry  I am going to repeal them after 2 years  Tell me  who will believe him  His credibility has been severely damaged  We are caving in on this issue and we should not be  
The polls show us the American people do not believe millionaires and billionaires need more tax breaks  If the calls to my office are indicative of what is going on in this country  there is overwhelming opposition to that agreement  
So I am saying that while the President says don't worry  that this is only temporary  I don't like it  But it is only 2 years  I have my doubts  I expect in 2 years  if this agreement goes forward  it will be extended again  As you know  Mr  President  they wanted 10 years on this extension of tax breaks for the rich  I have my strong suspicion that is exactly what will happen  if not made permanent  This country cannot afford to give tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires and have the middle class pay higher taxes to pay them off  
I want to say also that while a lot of attention has been focused on the personal income tax issue  that is not the only unfair tax proposal in this agreement  This agreement continues the Bush era 15 percent tax rate on capital gains and dividends  
Let me be clear about what that means  It means those people who make their living off of their investments if you invest  if you earn dividends will continue to pay a substantially lower tax rate than the average American person in the working class  middle class our firemen  our teachers  our nurses  Those people are not going to pay 15 percent  They pay a higher rate than folks who have capital gains and dividends  I think that is wrong  This agreement extends those provisions  
Furthermore and this is a point that has to be made over and over this agreement between the President and the Republicans lowers the estate tax rate to 35 percent  Under this agreement  the estate tax will decline to 35 percent  Under President Clinton  when the economy was much stronger  the estate tax was 55 percent  
Now  I know the Republicans have done a very good job in trying to convince the American people this is a so-called death tax; that in every family in America  when a loved one dies  the family is going to have to pay 35 percent  45 percent  or 55 percent  I have had people in Burlington  VT  come up to me and say  What are you doing  I have $30 000 in the bank that I want to leave to my kids  Why are you forcing my kids to pay such a large tax  
So let me be very clear  The Republicans have done a very good job in totally distorting this issue  
The estate tax is paid only by the top three-tenths of 1 percent of families in America  If you are in the middle class  even if you are modestly wealthy  even if you are wealthy  or if you are poor  if you are lower middle class  you don't pay a nickel in estate tax if somebody in your family were to die and leave you wealth not a nickel  This applies not just to the rich but to the very  very rich  
What the Republicans have been arguing for several years now is they want to repeal the estate tax entirely  If they were successful in doing that  that would mean increasing the national debt by $1 trillion over a 10-year period and all of the benefits not some  all of the benefits go to the top three-tenths of 1 percent; 99 7 percent of the people do not gain one nickel  
What is in this agreement is not what the Republicans ideally want  which is a repeal of the tax entirely  but what they do get is a reduction to 35 percent with an exemption on the first $5 million of an individual's estate  
Here is a chart which indicates just what I said a moment ago  ``Repealing the estate tax would add more than $1 trillion to the deficit over 10 years '' It is over $1 trillion  and the beneficiaries of it are just the very wealthy  
Let me give an example of what the repeal of the estate tax would mean  I will read it right off this chart  
Sam Walton's family  the heirs to the Wal-Mart fortune  are worth an estimated $86 8 billion  The Walton family would receive an estimated $32 7 billion tax break if the estate tax was completely repealed  
This is what our Republican friends want  
This agreement between the President and the Republicans certainly does not repeal the estate tax  but it does significantly lower the rates that the richest people  the very richest people in this country  would have to pay  
(Mr  UDALL of Colorado assumed the chair ) 
Two days ago  I brought to the floor of the Senate a very simple piece of legislation  I think how that legislation was treated speaks volumes about the debate we are having now  This legislation said that with over 50 million senior citizens on Social Security and disabled vets for the second year in a row not getting a cost-of-living adjustment  a COLA over 50 million seniors on Social Security and disabled vets not getting any COLA at all despite the fact their prescription drug costs are going up and their health care costs are going up  they got no COLA  I said I think that in these tough times  it is appropriate that we provide those folks if we cannot get them a COLA  let's get them the equivalent of a measly 2 percent COLA  a $250 check to all of our seniors and disabled vets  That is what we did  by the way  in the stimulus package  That is all  For over 50 million people  a $250 check costs our government about $14 billion  Yet I could not get one Republican vote in support of that  Republicans say  My goodness  imagine a senior or disabled vet living on $15 000 or $20 000 a year getting a $250 check  What an outrage  We have different priorities  they say  We want to give a $1 million tax break to somebody who earns $50 million a year  That about says it all  If you are very  very rich  the good news is you are going to get more tax breaks  But if you are a senior or disabled vet  we can't get you a $250 check  
I will say that the vote on the floor of the Senate was 53 people in favor of providing that one-time check  45 against 53 to 45  We won  But here in the Senate  majority does not rule  Republicans filibuster almost everything  and it requires 60 votes  We did not get the 60 votes  and seniors did not get that check  I am going to do my best to see that they do get it  We are going to bring that issue back and back again  
I raise that issue to tell you that one of the very weakest proposals in this agreement  totally outrageous  is the decrease in taxes for the estate tax  
There is another issue I want to touch on  I am going to spend a lot of time on this issue because it has not gotten the coverage and the attention I think it deserves  
This agreement deals with the so-called payroll tax holiday  I know the Vice President and the President and others have been touting this  They say this is really a good thing because it will put more money into the pockets of the working people  What will happen right now  if you are a worker  you put 6 2 percent into Social Security  It is going to be reduced for 1 year to 4 2 percent  You get the difference  and this is really a good thing  All of us want to see working people have more money in their pockets  That is what we do  That is what we are fighting for  
But let me be clear that while on the surface this so-called payroll tax holiday sounds like a good idea for working people  it is actually a very bad idea  What the American people should understand is that this payroll tax holiday originated from rightwing Republicans whose ultimate goal  trust me  is not to put more money into the pockets of working families; it is the ultimate destruction of Social Security  What they understand is that if we divert funding that is supposed to go into the Social Security trust fund  this will ultimately weaken the long-term financial viability of Social Security  In other words  what we are doing is  for the very first time  diverting money which is supposed to go into the Social Security trust fund and we are giving it to workers today  It is like eating our seed  
Rather than going into Social Security  the President says  Don't worry  this is going to be covered this year by the Federal Government  We have never seen that before  I don't want Social Security to be dependent on the Federal Government because the Federal Government has a $13 7 trillion national debt  And what I worry about is this is not just a 1-year provision; this also could be extended  
Let me quote Barbara Kennelly  
I am glad to see I am joined here on the floor by one of the strongest fighters for working families in the Senate  Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio  I just want to say this before I ask him a question or before he asks me a question or whatever the protocol is  
I want to quote what Barbara Kennelly  the president and CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare  said  This is one of the largest senior citizens groups in America  
Even though Social Security contributed nothing to the current economic crisis  it has been bartered in a deal that provides deficit-busting tax cuts for the wealthy  
Here is the key point  
Diverting $120 billion in Social Security contributions for a so-called ``tax holiday'' may sound like a good deal for workers now  but it's bad business for a program that a majority of middle-class seniors will rely upon in the future  
Barbara Kennelly  president and CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare  
I am joined by my very good friend from Ohio  and I want to ask him his sense of this overall agreement  
Mr  BROWN of Ohio  My sense is similar to yours  I was just on a TV show a minute ago  I was asked  the liberals or the conservatives  what they think about this  This really is not a liberal-conservative issue  First of all  the tax cuts overwhelmingly go to the wealthiest taxpayers  We are seeing the kinds of tax cuts that millionaires and billionaires get from the income tax and from the estate tax  But it is also equally important that it blows a hole in our budget deficit  
In some sense  we are borrowing tens of billions of dollars every year now if this agreement becomes law  we are borrowing tens of billions of dollars every year from the Chinese  and we are putting it on the credit cards of our children and grandchildren for them to pay off who knows when  and then we are giving these tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires  In those simple terms  it doesn't make sense  It doesn't make sense in our relationship with China  It doesn't make sense in the lost jobs that come from that China trade policy  It doesn't make sense in undermining the middle class  It doesn't make sense in terms of fairness in the tax system  It doesn't make sense for our children and grandchildren and the burden they are going to have to bear to pay off this debt  Giving a millionaire a tax cut and charging it to our kids  who are paying taxes on  unfortunately  in the last few years  declining wages  is morally reprehensible  
I know Senator Sanders has been on the floor 2 hours now talking about this and how important it is and really analyzing it and educating about it and all that  I think about the economic policy  too  that this embodies  
Nine or 10 years ago  Senator Sanders and the Presiding 
Officer  when he was a Member of the House  Senator Udall from Colorado  and I and others voted against the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003  principally because those tax cuts overwhelmingly went to the wealthy and ended up adding to our national debt  We had a surplus then  We sure don't now  We had the largest surplus we ever had in 2001  It blew a hole in that  But we passed those tax cuts under the belief  those who supported it President Bush and Senator McConnell and so many others under the belief that that kind of trickle-down economics would grow our economy  
In the 8 years and this is not partisan  this is not opinion  this is fact from January 1  2001  to January 1  2009  President Bush's 8 years  we actually had private sector job loss in this country  Contrast that with a different economic policy January 1  1993  to January 1  2001  the Clinton 8 years  Again  this isn't partisan  this isn't opinion  this is fact  During the Clinton 8 years  we had 21 million private sector jobs created 21 million private sector jobs created and literally zero private sector jobs in the Bush 8 years of trickle-down economics  
Why would we blow a hole in the budget  which this bill does  for our kids to pay off  Why would we continue an economic policy that clearly did not work for this country  It didn't work for the middle class  We saw middle-class wages not only no job increase during those 8 years  except for the people at the very top  we saw actual wage stagnation or worse  Most Americans did not get a raise during the 8 Bush years  Most Americans simply saw their wages flat or in many cases decline  The superwealthy saw a big increase in their incomes and in their net assets  And now we are going to give a tax break to them  
This is not class warfare  Lots of people I know have a lot of money  I don't have any ill will for them  But why would we help those people who have done so very well and then have our children pay for it  
Senator Sanders just mentioned the letter from Barbara Kennelly from one of the largest seniors organizations in the country and what this will mean for Social Security  Here is my fear  If this is passed  we are going to see our budget deficit increase  according to the Congressional Budget Office  about $900 billion because of this package  $800-some billion over the next couple of years  
As soon as it is signed by President Obama  even though it was negotiated with the Republican Senate leadership and overwhelming numbers of Republicans in the Senate and House I assume they are going to vote for it they are going to say  Look at the huge budget deficit President Obama created  From that day on  they are going to go after ways to cut the budget  That is OK  I agree we need to deal with spending and taxes and the whole picture  
But I also know from watching Republicans I saw them in the House when they moved toward Medicare privatization in 2003  2004  and 2005  They had some success  Fortunately  we were able to beat back most of it  I remember that in 2005  after President Bush was reelected in a very close race  he spoke repeatedly about privatizing Social Security  I know that is what they want to do  In the 1990s  Speaker Gingrich fortunately beaten back by President Clinton tried to privatize Medicare  
That is the way they cut the budget  they go after Medicare and Social Security  So this vote on this package to me  we need to call the President  write the President  work with the President to say  No deal  and this has to be something very different from what it is now because it will cause huge deficits our children and grandchildren will have to bear  It will not help the economy appreciably because we saw what the trickle-down economic policies of the Bush years did  It does not help the middle class enough  
So it is pretty clear to me how this jeopardizes Social Security  how it jeopardizes Medicare  how it will force more cuts and more pressure on those programs that have lifted so many people into the middle class  In 1965  when Medicare was first passed  half of the senior citizens in this country had no health insurance half of the seniors had no health insurance  Today 99 percent of seniors have health insurance  something like that  
I know we are a country now that has created a strong middle class  We have seen that middle class because of these tax cuts for the wealthy  trickle-down kind of economic policy  we have seen the middle class shrink in the last few years  I do not want that to keep happening  That is why I am very concerned about this  That is why I am working with the Senate to say  No deal  We need to much more seriously focus on not running up a huge debt  on making sure Social Security is protected  on an economic policy that works for the middle class  on a tax policy that is fair to the middle class  
That is why Senator Sanders' work is so important on the floor today  taking the floor for a longer period than anybody I have seen since I have been in the Senate  in a filibuster kind of setting  where he is raising these questions  asking these questions  educating the public  talking to people all over the country  in this Chamber and outside to change this policy  
Mr  SANDERS  If I could interrupt my friend from Ohio and ask him a question  it is on an issue the Senator dealt with last night  Talk about the kind of priorities we have seen in the Senate recently  where just a couple of days ago the Senator and I worked very hard to try to make sure seniors on Social Security and disabled vets were able to get a $250 check at a cost of $14 billion  we could not get one Republican vote for that  while at the same time Republicans are pushing tax breaks of over $1 million a year for the richest people in this country  Does that seem -- 
Mr  BROWN of Ohio  It tells a story  I came to the floor right after that vote  I had supported it all along  I cosponsored Senator Sanders' effort to bring that to the floor  for the $250 check for all seniors and all disabled veterans  I might add  not just Social Security beneficiaries  But I came to the floor right afterwards because I was pretty amazed  
I know there is partisanship here  I know some people think their whole view of the world is to give tax cuts to the richest people of the world and it will all trickle down and we will all do better  it will lift all boats  That is a pretty good economic theory you might have learned at Harvard or you might have learned at Johns Hopkins near here or wherever  But it does not work  It is a nice theory  but it does not work to lift all boats  
So Senator Sanders' effort was to provide a $250 check  one time  at a cost of $14 billion  But one time  not continued $14 billion one time for seniors who had not had a cost-of-living adjustment in 2 years  It just seemed to make so much sense when the average senior in this country gets about a $14 000-a-year Social Security check  I think that is about $1 200 a month  That is not their entire income for most seniors  but it is a big part of it  Many seniors live only on that  Many more seniors live on that  but only another couple $300  $400 a month  
There is not inflation maybe for people my age so much in this country  but if you are older and you have a lot of health care costs  there is inflation because the health care costs seem to go up higher than maybe anything but higher education  and maybe as much as that  So it was important that $250 be provided  we think  to every senior in the country and every disabled vet  
What was so amazing about it was that 42 Republican Senators signed a letter saying they would do nothing  nothing in the Senate  until tax cuts for the rich were approved  until they were signed into law  
Now  I have never seen Senators engage in a work stoppage or a strike  I mean  it was not quite a strike  which it is probably illegal for us to strike  I do not know  maybe  But it was a work stoppage  
They are saying  We are not doing anything until you give tax cuts to my rich friends  and I might say also to many people in the House and Senate whose income is in that bracket too  I am not accusing them of that  to be sure  but they were there for their rich friends and their biggest contributors and the wealthiest people in this country  But they were not there for a senior citizen living on $1 200 a month that could use that extra $250  
I have met too many seniors  and I know the Presiding Officer  when he travels to Colorado Springs or he goes to Cimarron or he goes to Denver  I know he hears seniors say  I cut my pills in half because I need my prescription to run for 2 months rather than 1 because I cannot afford it  Or I skipped my medicine today because my house is too cold  and I do not have enough heat  We know seniors make those choices  We make choices here  and the choice we made is 42 Republicans made it and blocked it because we need 60 votes  We had a majority of voters  an easy majority  for Senator Sanders' effort  53 votes  53 votes to do this  the $250  but we need 60 votes  
So 42 Republican Senators engaged in their work stoppage saying  We are not doing anything until we get these tax cuts for the rich  They said no to seniors  I am amazed by that  the callousness  I guess I am even more amazed when you consider what is today  the 10th when you consider in 2 weeks it is Christmas Day  That does not seem to bother them  It does not seem to bother them on unemployment benefits  And 85 000 Ohioans  a week and a half ago  lost their unemployment benefits 85 000  Their holiday season is ruined  
But I guess all of us will go home  I want to go home and be with Connie and my kids on Christmas  My children are grown  We have one grandchild  I want to be with him for as much of Christmas as I can  But we have a job to do today  this week and next week and this month and this year; and that is to extend unemployment benefits to people who have lost them  who are looking for jobs as hard as they can in a great majority of cases  and extending the tax cuts for the middle class and doing the right thing  So far  we have not done that  
I need to go to the airport  But I want to yield back to Senator Sanders for his work today  I hope next week  when we come back on Monday  we are prepared to do whatever it takes to say no deal on this one and to make this work for the middle class  make it work for Social Security beneficiaries  make it work for unemployed workers  
Mr  SANDERS  I thank my good friend from Ohio  one of the real fighters for working families in the Senate  not only for coming down here but for his years of efforts  But he makes a very important point  We have a job to do and the job is I know some people do not believe it  It is a rather radical concept  But our job is to represent working families  the middle class  and not the wealthiest people in this country  
I have four kids  six grandchildren  I look forward to spending the holidays with them  But you know what  We have a job to do  and if it means staying here through Christmas Eve  through New Year's  that is our job  And let's pass a proposal that works well for ordinary families and not just for the wealthiest people in this country  
I wanted to thank Senator Sherrod Brown for coming down  
What I want to say now is  when you look at this agreement  we have talked now about the absurdity  in the middle of a time when we have a $13 7 trillion national debt  of giving tax breaks to people who do not need it  Senator Brown and I have talked about the dangers inherent in this payroll tax holiday and what it might mean for the future of Social Security  But I also wanted to make another point; that is  that there are many billions of 
dollars in this proposal going to a variety of business tax cuts  Some of them  in fact  might work; some of them  in fact  might not work  But what is very clear is  if your goal is to create as many jobs as possible for every dollar of investment  this particular approach is not very effective  
When we talk about tax breaks for corporations and companies  what we should be aware of is that corporate America today today is sitting on close to $2 trillion in cash  They have that cash on hand  The problem is not that they do not have the money  the problem is that working people do not have the money to buy the products these guys are producing  I believe  and not just me but I think a variety of economists from across the board  it makes a lot more sense if we are serious about creating jobs to invest in our infrastructure  
I say that for a number of reasons  When you put money into roads and bridges and public transportation  you are creating  for every dollar you spend  far more jobs than giving a variety of tax breaks  That is an economic fact  
Second of all  when you are investing in our infrastructure  not only are you creating jobs short term  you are leaving the country with long-term improvement that increases our competitiveness in a very tough global economy  I mentioned a moment ago  and we will get back to it later  China is investing huge amounts of money into high-speed rail  into their roads  into their bridges  Yet if you drive around certain parts of America  you think we are a Third World nation  You have roads with all kinds of potholes  You have bridges which you cannot go across  You have rail systems where trains are going slower there is a study out there that I am going to get to later where somebody said that decades and decades ago  it took less time to go from various parts of this country to the other on trains than it does today because our rail beds are in such bad shape  
So if we are going to make our country competitive  we have to invest in infrastructure  It creates jobs  It adds long-term value to this country  Unfortunately  in this agreement  there is  to the best of my knowledge  not one nickel going into infrastructure  It is important that we  in fact  add provisions which do invest in our infrastructure and create jobs  
Another point that should be made when we look at this so-called compromise agreement established by the President and the Republican leadership is that in the agreement there is an extension of unemployment benefits for 13 months  Now  there is zero question  in my mind; that is something that absolutely has to be done  Right now Senator Brown made this point we have millions of Americans who have  through no fault of their own  lost their jobs  Maybe their plants went to China  Maybe their companies could not get the loans they needed to stay in business  Small businesses are going under  big businesses are shutting plants  No question we have to extend unemployment benefits  
But what bothers me is that this provision in this agreement  which is a good provision  suggests that this is a hard-won compromise; that the Republicans conceded something and they agreed to a 13-month extension of unemployment benefits  But here is the fact  The fact is  for the last 40 years  when unemployment rates have gone above 7 2 percent  Republicans and Democrats  in a nonpartisan way  have come together to say  of course  we are going to extend unemployment  This is America  We are not going to let working families who are suffering hard times because  through no fault of their own  they have lost their jobs  we are not going to let them lose their homes or not enable them to feed their families  This is America  We are not going to do that  
Republicans have said that for 40 years  Democrats have said that for 40 years  Democratic and Republican Presidents  leaders in the House and Senate  have said that  So to say  Oh  my goodness  the Republicans made a major concession; they are going to allow the extension of unemployment benefits for 13 months  that is not a concession  That has been bipartisan public policy for the last 40 years  
Now  I have been expressing to you and to the American people why I think this is not a good agreement  
why I think this agreement should be defeated and why I believe we can put together a much better agreement  
I do want to be clear  There are positive aspects to this agreement which should be maintained in an improved proposal  Let me mention some of them  This proposal  in addition to extending unemployment benefits for 13 months  extends the middle-class tax cuts  That is obviously something we have to do  The reality is that the middle class is collapsing  During the Bush years we saw a $2 200 decline per year in median family income  Working families are hurting  There is no question  To not extend that tax cut for 98 percent of America would be a travesty  So we have to maintain those tax cuts  and that is a positive thing in the agreement which obviously any future agreement must maintain  
Also in this agreement is the earned-income tax credit for working Americans  a very important provision  and the child and college tax credits are also in this agreement  These proposals will keep millions of Americans from slipping out of the middle class and into poverty  and they will allow millions of Americans to send their kids to college  I am not here to say to the President or the Vice President that there are not any good proposals and parts of this agreement  There are  But we can do much better  
What the President says and he makes a valid point show me the votes; he is good at counting  We tried a proposal here  where we only got 53 votes  which said we are going to extend the tax breaks for the middle class and not the very rich  The President knows  as everybody else knows  that around here Republicans filibuster everything  We need 60 votes  and he said  Show me the votes  This is what I would say  What our job right now is about is reaching out to the American people from one end of the country to the other  from California to Vermont  including a lot of our very conservative States  Frankly  it is not a conservative approach to substantially increase the national debt by giving tax breaks to billionaires  How many times have we been here on the floor hearing our Republican colleagues give long speeches about the danger and the unsustainability of a $13 7 trillion national debt and a $1 4 trillion deficit  We have heard it day after day  That is their mantra  If they believe that  why are they voting for a proposal that substantially increases the national debt for the very unproductive reason of giving tax breaks to the richest people who don't need it  
The reason we have to defeat this proposal and fight for a much better one is  I would hope that people throughout this country  from Vermont and Colorado  and many of our conservative States  would come forward and say  Wait a second  I do not want to see my kids and grandchildren pay more in taxes because we have borrowed money from China to increase the national debt in order to give tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires who have done extraordinarily well in recent years and  by the way  have seen a significant decline in their effective tax rate  
I know the Chair has heard wealthy people such as Warren Buffett make the point over and over again that what he really pays in taxes  his effective tax rate  is lower than his secretary's  All over this country we have examples where very rich people are able to stash money in the Cayman Islands  take advantage of all types of loopholes  and are paying rather low effective tax rates  in many cases lower than police officers or firemen or teachers or nurses  Opposition to this agreement should be tripartisan  We should have conservative Republicans  liberal Democrats  
I am an independent progressive  I can tell my colleagues in the last 3 days my office has received probably close to 3 000 phone calls  98 percent of them against this agreement  probably higher than 98 percent  and a huge number of e-mails also overwhelmingly against this agreement  I suspect I don't know it for a fact that this is the kind of message the American people are sending us all over America  But they have to continue to do so  They have to make it clear so we can win over at least a handful of Republicans and some wavering Democrats and say  Wait a second  We are not going to hold hostage extending middle-class tax breaks in order to give tax breaks to billionaires  We will not hold hostage extending unemployment for workers who have lost their jobs by giving tax breaks to people who don't need it  
If the American people give voice to what they are feeling  that this is not a good agreement  that we can do a lot better  I think we can defeat this proposal  and we can come back with a much better proposal which protects the unemployed  extends unemployment benefits  protects the middle class  extends the Bush tax cuts for 98 percent of the population  and protects a lot of important programs  making college more affordable  making childcare more affordable  and helping us transform our energy system  
There is a lot we can do if we defeat this proposal  We are not going to do it inside the beltway  Republicans are very united  But what we have to do is win at least a handful of them and some wavering Democrats to say  Mr  President  Republican leadership  you guys have to involve Congress in this discussion  
I was pleased yesterday that the Democratic caucus said  Sorry  we are not bringing that proposal onto the floor  I applaud Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic caucus for saying so  That took courage  Congressman Welch from the State of Vermont played an important role  Congressman Peter DeFazio played an important role  I congratulate him  I congratulate the caucus for saying we can do better than we are doing  
Let me be frank  We are not going to do better unless the American people stand up and help us  We are going to need a lot of phone calls  a lot of e-mails  a lot of messages so that all of our colleagues in the House and Senate understand the American people do not want to see their kids having to pay off the debt incurred by giving tax breaks to billionaires  
This agreement doesn't come out of the blue  It comes within a context that frightens many people  Many Americans have a sinking feeling that there is something very wrong in our country today  I know my father came to this country at the age of 17 without a penny in his pocket  He became the proudest American one could ever see  He didn't have much of an education  but he knew this country gave him a great opportunity  That is the American story  That is what it is all about  To millions and millions of families  whether they came from other countries  whether they just made it on their own I know we have heard the majority leader Harry Reid talking about his experience growing up in a desperately poor family that is what America is about  But there are a lot of folks out there who believe there is something wrong  and the facts back them up  
What is going on in this country is the middle class is collapsing  Poverty is increasing  I have four kids and six grandchildren  I am not worried about me  but I am worried about what happens to my kids and my grandchildren  We have some wonderful young pages here  and we worry about their futures as well  We don't want to see our kids and grandchildren be the first generation in the modern history of America to have a lower standard of living than their parents  We don't want to see this country's economy move in the wrong way  We don't want a race to the bottom  We want to see our kids live healthier and better lives than we do  not have to work longer hours  not getting a lower quality of education or less education  That is not the history of this great country  
I want to talk about one aspect of what is going on that does not get the kind of attention it deserves  There are obvious reasons why  having to do with who owns the media and corporate control of the media  having to do with who provides the campaign contributions that elect Members of the House and Senate  having to do with all the lobbyists who surround this institution  Wall Street and the oil companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars on campaign contributions  The issue I wish to discuss is who is winning and who is losing in this economy  I come from New England  Everybody follows the Celtics  We follow the Red Sox  the Patriots  What everyone asks is  who won the game  Did the Patriots win or lose  That is what we want to know  
In fact  in America  it is pretty clear in the economy who is winning and losing  The vast majority of people  working people  middle-class people  low-income people are losing  That is who is losing  It is clear who is winning  The wealthiest people are doing phenomenally well  They are winning the economic struggle  
In America today we don't talk about this too much  but it is time we did we have the most unequal distribution of wealth and income in the industrialized world  I haven't heard too many people talk about that issue  Why not  Our Republican colleagues want huge tax breaks for the richest people  but the reality is the top 1 percent already today owns more wealth than the bottom 90 percent  How much more do they want  When is enough enough  Do they want it all  We already have millions of families today who have zero wealth  They owe more than they own  Millions of families have below zero wealth  We are living in a situation where the top 1 percent owns more wealth than the bottom 90 percent  The top 1 percent owns more wealth than the bottom 90 percent  That is simply unacceptable  
This is something we must be absolutely ashamed about and have to address  instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires  Maybe we should appreciate the fact that about 25 percent of our children are dependent on food stamps  We should understand that in the industrialized world  the United States  as this chart shows  has the highest rate of childhood poverty  Is this America  Is this America  The United States today has over 20 percent of its kids living in poverty  In Finland  the number is about 2 or 3 percent; Norway  maybe 4 percent; Sweden  maybe 4 5 percent; Switzerland  6 percent  whatever it may be  But here we are  If people are watching on television  what they are seeing is the red line  Here is the United States  well over 20 percent  Here is the Netherlands in second place  It looks to me like about 7 percent  This is the future of America  So we are sitting here talking about an agreement which says  Let's give huge tax breaks to billionaires  And here is the reality  We have a rate of childhood poverty far surpassing any other country on Earth  
This is the other half of the equation  What do my colleagues think happens when we have millions of kids living in poverty  What do my colleagues think happens when we have kids who are dropping out of school when they are 13 or 14  I talked to a fellow in Vermont who runs one of our jails  He said about half the kids who drop out of school end up in the penal system  That is what happens  The result is  the highest rate of childhood poverty in the industrialized world  and then what we end up with is more people behind bars than any other country on Earth  
China is a Communist totalitarian society  much larger than the United States  which is a democratic society  We have more people in jail than China and more people in jail than any other country  So what we end up doing  which seems to be not terribly bright  is spending perhaps $50 000 a year keeping people in jail because they dropped out of school  They never found a job  They got hooked on drugs or whatever  We pay to put them in jail rather than investing in childcare  in education  in sustaining their families  
So when we look at the context in which this agreement was reached  we have to see that it takes place at a time when the rich are already doing phenomenally well  while we have the highest rate of childhood poverty in the industrialized world  
During the 8 years of President Bush  the wealthiest 400 Americans that is not a lot of people  400 families saw their income more than double while their income tax rates dropped almost in half  So you have 400 families all of whom are already multi-multimillionaires where during the 8 years of President Bush their income more than doubled while their income tax rates dropped almost in half  
I would say to my colleagues in the Senate  we do not have to worry about these guys  They are doing just fine  They do not need an extension of tax breaks  The wealthiest 400 Americans now earn  on average  $345 million a year  and they pay an effective tax rate of 16 6 percent  How is that  All right  The top 400 wealthiest people in this country earn $345 million a year  and they pay an effective tax rate of 16 6 percent  They do not need an extension of tax breaks  
By the way  for the United States of America  this effective tax rate of 16 6 percent  on average  is the lowest tax rate for the very rich in America that there has ever been  So we have already given the wealthiest people in this country the lowest effective tax rates in the history of our country  at least since they have been keeping records  That is what we have done  So the idea of giving these guys who are doing phenomenally well  who already own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent more tax breaks is totally absurd  
Under the 8 years of President Bush  the wealthiest 400 Americans we talked about how they doubled their incomes; income is what happens in 1 year under the 8 years of President Bush  the wealthiest 400 Americans increased their wealth by more than $380 billion  Four hundred families increased their wealth by $380 billion  That averages to almost $1 billion a family  Mr  President  $1 billion in 8 years  That is the average; some  obviously  more  
Collectively I know this is not an issue we talk about too much the 400 richest Americans have accumulated $1 27 trillion in wealth  If any of them die this year  their heirs can receive  right now  all of this money tax free because the inheritance tax has been eliminated in 2010 as part of the Bush estate tax repeal this year  
Last year  the top 25 hedge fund managers made a combined $25 billion in income a combined $1 billion per person  OK  So if you are a hedge fund manager  you are doing pretty good  I mentioned a moment ago that we tried just the other day to get checks of $250 out for disabled vets and senior citizens on Social Security who have not had a COLA in 2 years  We could not get them that check  But last year the top 25 hedge fund managers made a combined $25 billion in income $1 billion per person  And our Republican friends say  Oh  my word  my word  we have to lower their taxes  Last year  ExxonMobil  Bank of America  and other large profitable corporations paid no Federal income taxes  
So what you have is a tax system which is totally distorted in the sense that it allows large profitable corporations to pay  in some cases in many cases zero  In fact  last year it would be funny if it really was not pathetic as I understand it  ExxonMobil  which made $19 billion  paid nothing in taxes  Bank of America Bank of America got a huge bailout from the American taxpayer  paying their executives all kinds of fancy  huge compensation packages got a refund check from the IRS  That is how absurd the situation is  And people say  Oh  my word  in order to deal with our deficit  we are going to have to cut back on Medicare and Medicaid and education  We cannot afford it  I guess we can afford to allow ExxonMobil  the most profitable corporation in the history of the world  to make huge sums of money and pay nothing in taxes  We can afford to do that  but we cannot afford to protect working families and the middle class  
In the year 2005  one out of every four large corporations in the United States paid no Federal income tax on revenue of $1 1 trillion  Now  what do you think  Maybe before we start cutting Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid and veterans programs  we would want to ask some of these very large and profitable corporations to pay at least something in taxes  From 1998 to 2005  two out of every three corporations in the United States paid no Federal income taxes  according to the GAO report  
Sadly  the economic pain millions of people are experiencing did not even begin as a result of the Wall Street bailout  The middle class was collapsing long before that  It is wrong to blame Bush for all the problems  He contributed a lot to it but not all of it  That trend has been going on for many years  
As the Washington Post reported last January let me quote from an article because  again  I want to put the economic reality facing the middle class in contrast to the economic reality facing the very rich in the broad context of this agreement signed by the President and the Republican leadership  As the Washington Post reported last January  
The past decade  
The Bush 8 years plus 2 years  
was the worst for the U S  economy in modern times  ..... 
It was  according to a wide range of data  a lost decade for American workers  
``A lost decade for American workers '' Do you know why people are furious  Do you know why they are angry at Washington and everybody else  The last decade was  according to the Washington Post  a lost decade for American workers  
There has been zero net job creation since December 1999  
Twelve years of zero job creation  which is why unemployment is so high  not only for the general population but even worse for our young people  kids getting out of high school  young people graduating college  
According to the Washington Post this came from the Washington Post in January  
Middle-income households made less in 2008  when adjusted for inflation  than they did in 1999  ..... 
In other words  the American economy has turned into a nightmare for tens of millions of families  Imagine that  
Middle-income households made less in 2008  when adjusted for inflation  than they did in 1999 and the number is sure to have declined further during a difficult 2009  
They did not have those numbers  but because of the Wall Street collapse  that certainly is the case  
So what are we talking about  We are talking about  as I have just demonstrated  the people on top seeing a doubling of their income  while their effective tax rates are going down  You are seeing the middle class collapsing  
What this agreement says is that we are going to provide huge tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires  That is insane  Only within the beltway could an agreement such as that be negotiated  
As I mentioned earlier  in the last 3 days  we have received thousands and thousands and thousands of phone calls and e-mails to my office  and over 98 percent I daresay 99 percent say this is not a good agreement  do not support it  
Mr  President  I have been joined on the floor by the very distinguished Senator from the State of Louisiana  I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to enter into a colloquy with Senator Landrieu  
The PRESIDING OFFICER  Is there objection  
Without objection  it is so ordered  
Mr  SANDERS  I thank Senator Landrieu very much for joining us here  I wondered if the Senator could give the American people her thoughts about this agreement and what has been going on  
Ms  LANDRIEU  Mr  President  I thank the Senator from Vermont for his eloquent and passionate presentation for hours this morning  He clearly has presented to this Chamber and to the American people some stark realities that are unpleasant  Some people might even find them hard to believe  But he has done his homework  He has documented what he said  In that backdrop  it does make this agreement  made between the Republican leadership and the President of the United States  even harder for some of us to understand  
I want to acknowledge  as the Senator said I know there are pressures on all sides  and time is running out; we have to make a decision about tax cuts in a short period of time  We do not have the benefit of several months or even half a year  I understand the pressures of time  But as the Senator from Vermont pointed out  how about the pressures on the middle class  What about these pressures  What about this pain  
I was wondering  because I wanted to ask the Senator from Vermont I was not able to follow his entire presentation this morning did he quote from the report ``Income Inequality and the Great Recession '' done by the U S  Congress Joint Economic Committee  led by Charles Schumer  I ask the Senator  did you quote from this report  
Mr  SANDERS  We quoted from a number of studies  but not that one  I say to the Senator  
Ms  LANDRIEU  I would like to add in our colloquy  if the Senator is aware  according to this report that just came out in September of this year  
Income inequality has skyrocketed  Economists concur that income inequality has risen dramatically over the past three decades  
Middle-class incomes stagnated under President Bush  During the recovery of the 1990s under President Clinton  middle-class incomes grew at a healthy pace  However  during the jobless recovery of the 2000s under President Bush  that trend reversed course  Middle-class incomes continued to fall well into the recovery  and never regained their 2001 high  
The report goes on to say which is frightening  which is why I have been raising my voice in opposition so strongly to some parts of this package  
High levels of income inequality may precipitate economic crises  
In other words  if the middle class cannot see light at the end of the tunnel and if the economy itself cannot grasp a way for the middle class to grow  I say to the Senator  this recession may never end no matter how much money you give to the very wealthy  
This is the reality we are facing at this moment how to end this recession  
Republicans weren't completely to blame for it  Democrats weren't completely innocent  or vice versa  It is not about who to blame  it is about how to fix it  We are about to pick up a $980 billion hammer next week in an attempt to fix it  Are we hitting the nail right  We don't have many $980 billion hammers to pick up  We are borrowing this one  So let's get it right  This is an important issue before our country  I think that is what the Senator is saying  
Am I putting words into the Senator's mouth  Is this what the Senator is trying to explain  
Mr  SANDERS  Exactly  The point cannot be understated  What Senator Landrieu is saying is that if you have a collapsing middle class and people are unable to purchase anything  it impacts the entire economy  The economy can't grow  We can't grow jobs if people don't have enough money to buy products made by other people  If all or a substantial part of the wealth in this Nation accrues in the hands of a few  they get three yachts and eight airplanes  I guess  but there is a limit to what they can purchase  
Ms  LANDRIEU  And there is a limit to what they can consume  
What the Senator from Vermont is saying and what I am saying I want to be very clear  because the Senator and I don't agree on every piece of legislation  He tends to be a little bit more liberal and progressive in his politics than I am  but on this subject we are both equally concerned about the shrinking of the middle class  From my perspective the Senator may have a different view I am talking about the broad middle class  incomes of $50 000 to $500 000  In my State  $500 000 of income not net worth but income is a huge amount of money  In fact  I brought a graph to show that 84 percent of the households in Louisiana when I talk about middle class 84 percent of the households in Louisiana make less than $75 000  I said 84 percent  Most people in Louisiana most believe they are in the middle class  but 84 percent make below $75 000  
So when I use the term middle class and we all have a different view I am saying the broad middle class with incomes between $50 000 and $500 000  If you have $500 000 in income  you are quite wealthy in Louisiana  but I realize we are not New York  Connecticut  or California  Maybe if you make $500 000 or $400 000 in some of these places  you don't consider yourself very wealthy or rich  I think by Louisiana standards you would be  but this is a big nation  So I want to be as broad as I can possibly be here  I am not talking about the wealthy being $400 000 or $500 000  That may not be the case in California  But what we are talking about in this tax bill is borrowing $50 billion to give tax breaks to families earning over $1 million  So as the Senator from Vermont said  whether you put your mark at $250 000 or $500 000 we can disagree about how broad the middle class is  but is there anyone anyone anyone in this Chamber on either side of the aisle from any State who believes seriously  giving what the Senator from Vermont just outlined which is really not debatable; these economic studies are not just from one side of the aisle or another that we should actually next week provide $50 billion in extended benefits for the families in America who are making more than $1 million a year  Should we do that when the inequities are so great  when the needs of the middle class are so great  when there is no evidence to suggest from any I have seen that is convincing that even after this tax cut the recession will end  We are doing this for 2 years  What happens if the recession doesn't end and we have borrowed all of this money to provide the extension of these tax cuts  as well as giving $50 billion to the $1 million earners in this country  What do we do then  Go borrow another trillion and try it again  I think we have to try something different  
I don't know if the Senator has another point before I go into a few thoughts  
Mr  SANDERS  Let me ask the Senator and I thank her very much and I agree with what she has been saying  I was mentioning earlier the calls coming in and the e-mails coming into my office are overwhelming  99 percent against this  Are you getting similar calls  
Ms  LANDRIEU  I am getting calls  and I am getting about 50 percent for and 50 percent against  The State of Louisiana is a little different than the State of Vermont  Many of the calls coming in from around the country are against giving well  actually  let me say this  Most of the calls coming in are absolutely against giving tax cuts to people over $1 million  
Mr  SANDERS  That is what I am talking about  
Ms  LANDRIEU  Overwhelmingly  people are calling in and saying  Is that really happening  In fact  my office told me today that actually 10 people called who had incomes over $1 million  which I found very interesting  to say they supported my position  Tell Senator Landrieu I make $1 million a year and I agree with her  So I know people are listening  I thank those callers  They make $1 million every year and they said  Please  use the money for somebody else or something else  I am doing fine  I am counting my blessings  I survived the recession  They know that 33 000 people are getting ready to run out of unemployment benefits in Louisiana alone if we don't extend it  They know middle-class families making over $75 000 in income or $200 000 in income or even $500 000 you can have $300 000 of income in Louisiana and be a strong business person and doing very well  and have eight children  The Presiding Officer has large families out in the West  We have very large families in the South  No one ever gives us credit enough  I think  for that  People work very hard  a mother and a father  Their income might be $200 000  $250 000  but with six children  that doesn't go that far these days  I grew up in a neighborhood where we routinely had 12 children in a house  How much money do you think you have to make to feed and clothe and send to college 12 children  My father sent nine of us to college  We never made anywhere near that money  I still think it was a miracle any of us ever got there  
But  nonetheless  the issue is next week we are going to debate this agreement  I wish to say I support extending tax cuts to the middle class  to the broad middle class  But there is something terribly wrong here in Denmark  Something is not right in Denmark if we are spending or borrowing $50 billion  which is about what it costs to extend income tax rates  the lower rate and the dividend rates  and the capital gains rates to people making over $1 million  
Someone on the radio today said  Well  Senator  don't you think giving tax cuts will stimulate the economy  I said  No  I am not an economist  but every economist I have read on this tax package says that is one of the least stimulative am I correct  Senator one of the least stimulative provisions of the bill  
I want to know next week  when we are debating this  I would like at least one Republican just one it could be the minority leader Mitch McConnell  it could be the budget chairman Judd Gregg  it could be just one Republican to give a passionate argument for why they insisted this be in the package  I would like to listen to it  I would like to hear it with my own ears  What was it about it that they thought was so important that they had to have it in the package  Because I know  as angry as I am with the President right now about some matters  I know the President did not insist this be in the package  I know enough about him to know that he didn't call everybody in the room and say  Oh  we forgot something  Let's make sure this tax extension includes people making over $1 million  I know he didn't give that speech  I want to know who did  Who did give it  because your constituents should know about it  And the American people have a right to know  That is one thing about our democracy  it is open  It could be more open  We could be like Britain where they all stand up and talk at one another in one of the rooms  It is very interesting  I find it very interesting to watch sometimes  We don't do that  but at least if the people of Britain want to know what their people are saying  they can hear them  
Somebody said this  I would like to know who  and where  and when  Was it in the Oval Office  Was it in the cloakroom  Because I am going to be forced to vote because now  I think the Senator understands  we aren't going to have any amendments  so I am going to be forced to vote and have to choose  which is going to be a very tough choice  between extending tax cuts for 84 percent of the people in my State who make less than $75 000 which of course I want to do  Even though we have to borrow the money to do it  we can't not do it  The economic circumstances are such that we have to do it  But now  in order to get them help  I have to say yes to something that I have talked about and I want to be serious about this; I am very serious about it that  for me  borders on moral recklessness  
I have been criticized on both sides of this debate  How can you use words like this  I don't know  I went to Catholic school  We went to mass almost every week  Every week the priest would say  Don't take more than you need  Don't be greedy  Share with others  Did I go to the wrong school  So I would like to know  Maybe those lessons were missed on the other side  I don't normally speak like this  I have been criticized for it  I am very  very torn  because I like to be part of a team  
I understand  I say to the Senator from Vermont  that we can't have every package exactly the way we believe  I understand that  I have had to vote for some things that were hard for me to stomach  and I have done it because there were other good things in the bill  That is the way the process works  But I actually cannot remember a time on either an appropriations bill of this magnitude or a tax bill of this magnitude that we have been asked to cast a vote for something that on its face is so reckless  so unnecessary  so sort of in your face to the poor  in your face to the middle class  We are going to take our money  Don't you say a word about it  
Who said that  Did Warren Buffett come down here and ask for it  Did Boone Pickens come down here and ask for it  Did the Gateses come down here and ask for it  Who asked for it  Why do you think you deserve it  and what Senator put their name on it  
I have a few more things to say  I don't want to keep the Senator from Vermont tied up  
Mr  SANDERS  Quite the contrary  The Senator from Louisiana is making some very important points  I appreciate it and I look forward to hearing what she has to say  
Ms  LANDRIEU  Thank you  I wish to say a few other things about this whole situation  because the Senator from Vermont and I agree on some things and parts of this obviously this part but we had a big difference  I wanted to show this from my perspective  
I voted for the original tax cuts  I am not sure the Senator from Vermont did  There were very good reasons on both sides  I wish to take a minute  because I have  as I said  critics on both sides  and I want to explain not explain  but share some thoughts about that and make something very clear  
I was one of 12 Democrats there are only 7 of us left in the Chamber today who voted for the Bush tax cuts  We were for the middle class and the poor and the wealthy  Everybody got income tax relief  capital gains tax relief  dividend tax relief  Senator Lincoln and I and others worked very hard to make sure that in that package even though I would have designed it differently if I could have done it myself  but there are no czars around here  This is a democracy  I understand that  I have been doing it for 30 years  We worked hard to shape that package the best we could to direct it and target it to the middle class  There are many critics of that who say you didn't do it well enough  You didn't send it to the middle class  You sent it to the wealthy  I disagree  I think we did as well as we could to send it to the middle class  although the higher brackets were lowered as well  But I will tell my colleagues the big difference was  it was paid for when we voted for it  There was a $128 billion annual surplus  In other words  we were spending $128 billion less than we were taking in  What a happy time that was  We were paying for our Pell grants  We were paying for education  We were paying for health care  We had surpluses in Social Security  the Senator will remember  and we had a $128 billion surplus that year alone  and surpluses as far as the eye can see  This is before 9/11  
So the 12 of us let me speak just for myself I thought  what a situation this is  Democrats had taken the tough vote  Not one Republican had voted for this budget reconciliation  As the Chair knows  as he was then in the House and took a tough vote with the Democrats to put us on that path  the middle class was expanding  Jobs were being created  We were creating millionaires  Yes  I love creating more millionaires  It is why I got into politics one of the reasons  I like when people are successful  I love to hear stories about my constituents who came from poor families  whose mothers were household servants  whose fathers never went to high school I love to hear about smart little girls from Gert Town who got straight As in school  went down the street to Xavier University  got their premed degree  and then went on to become a doctor  and now they are millionaires  I don't decry that  I celebrate it  I have fought for them to get their scholarships not individually but generally  It is what I do  It is what Senators and House Members do  
I am so mad at people saying to me  as a Democrat  that we don't like people who are rich; that we have something against them  Nothing could be further from the truth  
I love the book  ``The Millionaire Next Door '' It talks about how it is a myth that most millionaires in America have inherited their money  The fact is  we have created such a great country over 250 years  We have actually found the way for poor people to go from nothing to huge wealth and to create a life-changing opportunity for their children and grandchildren  We celebrate it  write movies about it  and our libraries are full of books about it  There is nothing wrong with that  
So when we had a surplus  I thought we should give tax breaks and use some of that money  But  today  we are being asked to provide tax cuts  when the deficit is I want to get this number correct because it is shocking 10 times greater than the surplus; it is $1 294 trillion  That is what the annual deficit is this year  When we did the tax cuts  we were generating a $128 billion surplus every year surpluses as far as the eye could see  We thought maybe we should give a third of this bounty in tax cuts  and we made investments in other things  But  today  after what the Senator from Vermont has described as the economic inequality in the country  when we have no surplus in sight  the biggest  largest  most ferocious recession since the Great Depression  and we are running an annual deficit of $1 29 trillion someone had the nerve on the other side of the aisle to say  Wait  before you close the deal  before you shut the door  before you stop the printing press  please put in the people in America who make over $1 million  
Now  for that $50 billion  there are lots of ways that we could save if we could correct this deal  I don't think we can  But if we could  as the Senator knows  do we have men and women in the military does he know what their COLA will be this year  I think it is only 1 4 percent  
Mr  SANDERS  That is what my understanding is  I think a lot of the folks in the military are very upset about that  
Ms  LANDRIEU  Every person in uniform is only getting a COLA this year of 1 4 percent  Did anybody over there not think about this when they raised their hand to say let's give it to millionaires  Those in the military most certainly deserve a bonus  They are coming back without eyes or legs; they are leaving some of their limbs in Iraq and Afghanistan  Did anybody over there think about that  
The senior citizens for whom the Senator has been such an advocate are not seeing the kind of COLA they normally get  Talk about stimulus  I think every dollar you give to a senior citizen wouldn't the Senator say gets spent right away  They have to buy food with it  They are not going out perusing a yacht or an airplane they could or could not buy  They need to eat  They go to the corner drugstore; they need to get their medicine  They spend it  Yes  we give money to the poor on the Democratic side and the middle class because it is the right thing to do  It actually happens to be also the smart thing to do for the economy and for jobs  
So when people say the Senator has flip-flopped on taxes  I don't understand how to say it differently  I voted for tax cuts when we had a surplus  I am challenged about how to address this package I most certainly want to extend it for the middle class and to extend help for the unemployment  People are unemployed not because they are lazy  for Heaven's sake  They are unemployed because there are no jobs for them  It is some of the longest term unemployment we have had in our Nation's history  
So the other side is making us feel they say  We gave you the unemployment  so surely you should give us the tax breaks for millionaires  Is that really an equal trade  If somebody believes that actually I have heard commentators say it on different networks  I have been on these news programs  and they say  You got the unemployment  so that is a fair trade  
If there is a Senator who thinks that  I would love them to say that next week  I think that would be great to have on the record  So this situation is what the Louisiana families in my State are facing  Obviously  I would like to provide tax relief for these families  We have less than 1 8 percent who are making over $200 000  I am checking right now to find out how many families in Louisiana actually make over $1 million  I was told it was 3 200  That number might be too high  The Senator from West Virginia told me that in his State it is 599 people who make over $1 million a year  Yet it looks like that is the package  
We are going to be in a tough situation  without amendments  having to vote for it  I will see what my constituents are saying over the weekend  I want to say one more thing about this inequity and turn it back over to the Senator from Vermont  Besides the other things that were put into the Record about the inequality  the challenges before our country right now  I came across some data  and I would like the Senator to be on the floor to listen to this  
Mr  SANDERS  I am not going anywhere  You can take as much time as you want  
Ms  LANDRIEU  I wasn't sure what his time was  I am chair of the Small Business Committee  I have many hearings  but I had one in the last 3 months and some of the testimony was startling to me  I wanted to share this with the Senator  
It is in the 2000 census data  Someone was testifying about why this recession was taking so long to get over  They were giving figures about the status of the economy and the wealth or incomes of broad sections of the population  
They said sort of off the cuff like  ho-hum  today is Monday  
They said  By the way  the average net worth  the median net worth of households in America  the average median net worth not income but net worth of households is $67 000  That is very interesting  I thought it would be higher than that  That is taking what you own minus everything you owe  and the difference is your net worth  I thought people might have more than that in terms of equity in their homes  a couple hundred thousand  That was concerning to me  
I said  Do you have that broken down by race  by any chance  
They said  Yes  ma'am  
I said  Would you share it  And they did  I will share it with you because I have not recovered from what I heard  
The gentlemen said to me  Well  for White families in America  the average median 50 percent more  50 percent less is $87 000  For Hispanic families  it is $8 000  For African-American families  it is $5 000  
I want to repeat that  Fifty percent of all families in America who are Caucasian  their net worth is $67 000 or less  For Hispanic families in America  50 percent of all Hispanic households  their net worth is $8 000  For African-American families today  in 2010 40 years after the peak of the civil rights movement and 150 years or so after the Civil War and all the things we think we have done to try to get people in a more equal position in our society it is $5 000  That is including home equity or home ownership  I mean  Without home ownership  that net worth for African-American families falls to $1 000  
So when people say people are in pain and suffering and anxious and they can't buy anything  you wonder why  There is no cushion in a recession like this  How brutal is a recession to people who have so little a cushion  For a middle-class family of any race  if you lose your job  you can get unemployment  you have some equity in your home  or maybe you have some savings you can fall back on  There is a cushion  and you can bounce back up  How brutal is this recession to millions of families in America who have no cushion  They are just hitting hard rock  They are hitting steel  There is no cushion there  You wonder why people are angry  You wonder why this tea party movement is festering  why people are so angry  I understand that anger  I am so angry myself  I don't know what to do  
Mr  SANDERS  If I can interrupt my good friend  she is right  It is no great secret that her politics and mine aren't the same on many issues  She is down here speaking from her heart  coming from the State of Louisiana  which is not radically different from Vermont  We have a lot of struggling families  
I want to reiterate a point  She has been talking so effectively about the stress on the middle class and working families in her State and around the country  I want to reiterate this point  I am not here to pick on George W  Bush  but during his 8 years  the wealthiest 400 Americans pretty high up guys; that ``ain't'' the middle class no matter how broadly you define that their income more than doubled got that while their income tax rate dropped almost in half  
The wealthiest 400 Americans now earn an average of $345 million a year and pay an effective tax rate of 16 6 percent  on average  That is the lowest tax rate for wealthy individuals on record  
So the point is  Senator Landrieu and I are talking about the people out in the real world who are working longer hours for lower wages  Median family income has declined  People are scared that for the first time in our modern history their kids will have a lower standard of living than they had  
Is the Senator hearing that in Louisiana  
Ms  LANDRIEU  I am  
Mr  SANDERS  Senator Landrieu is asking a simple question  and millions of people are asking the same question  The wealthiest people are becoming much richer  the middle class is declining  and poverty is increasing  Who decided  Who said billionaires need an extended tax break and a reduction in the estate tax  It is a very simple question she is asking  It is a very profound question because it speaks to what this country is all about  I didn't mean to interrupt  
Ms  LANDRIEU  I thank the Senator from Vermont  I commend to my colleagues this report entitled ``Income Inequality and the Great Recession'' from Senator Schumer and the Joint Economic Committee  I ask unanimous consent that the Executive Summary be printed in the Record  
There being no objection  the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD  as follows  
Income Inequality and the Great Recession 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
This week  the U S  Census Bureau will release new statistics on income inequality in the United States  allowing for an assessment of the impact of the Great Recession on our nation's income distribution  In preparation for that data release  the Joint Economic Committee (JEC) analyzed income inequality in the United States in the years preceding the Great Recession  and found  
Income inequality has skyrocketed  Economists concur that income inequality has risen dramatically over the past three decades  
Middle-class incomes stagnated under President Bush  During the recovery of the 1990s under President Clinton  middle-class incomes grew at a healthy pace  However  during the jobless recovery of the 2000s under President Bush  that trend reversed course  Middle-class incomes continued to fall well into the recovery  and never regained their 2001 high  The first year of the Great Recession dealt a sharp blow to middle-class families  who had not yet recovered from the pain of the last recession  
High levels of income inequality may precipitate economic crises  Peaks in income inequality preceded both the Great Depression and the Great Recession  suggesting that high levels of income inequality may destabilize the economy as a whole  
Income inequality may be part of the root cause of the Great Recession  Stagnant incomes for all but the wealthiest Americans meant an increased demand for credit  fueling the growth of an unsustainable credit bubble  Bank deregulation allowed financial institutions to create new exotic products in which the ever-richer rich could invest  The result was a bubble-based economy that came crashing down in late 2007  
Policymakers have a great deal of leverage in mitigating income inequality in order to stabilize the macro-economy  In the decades following the Great Depression  policy decisions helped keep income inequality low while allowing for continued economic growth  In contrast  policy decisions made during the economic expansion during the Bush administration failed to keep income inequality in check  and may have exacerbated the problem  Policymakers working to rebuild the economy in the wake of the Great Recession should heed these lessons and pay particular attention to policy options that mitigate economic inequality  
Ms  LANDRIEU  Mr  President  I want to go back to a point about this so that I am not misunderstood  I guess no matter what I say critics will take it and do what they will with it  but I am not against tax cuts  I voted for them many times in my life when we had surpluses  I have even been pressured to vote for things  and have done so  when we didn't have the surpluses  but they were targeted and focused and there actually had been some rational thought attached to where we might need to borrow some money and spend it  such as in the stimulus package  because in that instance  if we didn't get some spending going  we could slip further into a recession  Even conservative economists counseled us on parts of the stimulus package  
By the way  contrary to popular myth  that was about the same size as this package  This package is actually larger  This package is going to be $900 billion  The stimulus was $800-something  It was less  But in that stimulus package about a third was tax cuts  Remember that  Mr  President  A third of that was tax cuts  It wasn't all just spending  But every economist conservative  liberal said the government has got to step up and spend in this economy because this place is shutting down meaning the country and so we did  
People will still argue on the other side that was the wrong thing to do and we shouldn't have done it  But I am here to say that without the $2 8 billion in tax cuts and spending that went to Louisiana through that stimulus package and my State legislature is struggling to balance the budget  as I speak; they have been in the budget committee over the past couple of weeks I don't know where we would be today  I don't know how much went to Vermont or California or how much went to Colorado  but people say it was a failure  Well  let me say that $2 8 billion went to our State and it warded off some Draconian cuts that our cities and counties and parishes would have had to make  and it warded off tax increases so that Governors didn't have to raise taxes and mayors didn't have to raise taxes all over this country  Some of them have done that  but they have tried to limit it because they know how fragile this middle class is  
I am not unmindful of the importance of providing tax cuts when we can  But when we are asked to vote on a package that has a provision such as this  that borders on moral recklessness  I have to catch my breath and ask  Whose idea was this  I wish to know  
It is going to be a long weekend  It will be a long 30 hours of debate  I am glad the Senator from Vermont is going to make sure we take every one of those 30 hours postcloture  if we even get to cloture on this bill  because I think the American people are going to be waiting around to find out whose idea was that  
Mr  SANDERS  If I can interrupt the Senator from Louisiana  because she makes a very important point  we are a democracy and it is the American people who make the decisions  I know she shares with me the belief that the American people have to become engaged in this very important debate  which has a lot to do with the future of this country  
Senator Landrieu asks a very simple question  which I would like and I think the American people would like an answer to  Whose brilliant idea was it at a time when we have seen an explosion in income and wealth to the people on top  while their tax rates have already gone down that we drive up the national debt and ask our kids to pay higher taxes to pay off that debt in order to give tax breaks to people who don't need them  That is the question Senator Landrieu is asking  I think the American people need an answer to that  and my hope is that millions of Americans will start calling their Senators to ask that question  
Ms  LANDRIEU  Was it your idea  Whose idea was it  
Mr  SANDERS  Whose idea was it  
The irony here and I think Senator Landrieu made this point as well is that there are plenty of millionaires out there who say  I don't need it  I am more worried about the crumbling infrastructure or our kids out there than giving me a tax break I don't need  Thanks very much  That is what Warren Buffett has said  It is what Bill Gates has said  Ben Cohen of Ben & Jerry's has said it  Many millionaires have said it  We are giving some of these guys something they do not even want  
I want to thank Senator Landrieu very much  not only for her being here today and please continue but for raising these important issues  
Ms  LANDRIEU  One more point  and then I will turn this back over to the Senator  
I was on the Greta Van Susteren show last night  I have said Greta is always a tough interviewer  but she is fair  so I am happy to go on her program  And it was a tough interview  But we debated these things  and I think that is important  I think it is important to debate them here  on TV  and in townhall meetings  That is what democracy is all about  But she said to me  Senator  we are so frustrated  Nobody ever hears anybody say they want to cut spending  or they want to eliminate waste  fraud  and abuse  So let me concede this point  For me  I don't think we do talk enough about eliminating the waste  eliminating the fraud  and eliminating the abuse  I think we should spend more time  and I am going to commit myself to that  because I know the American people say  Every time we ask for a tax cut  you say we can't afford it  Why don't you cut some spending  et cetera  
Let me state that I voted for tax cuts  I am for tax cuts  I have even given tax cuts to people who do make higher than the $75 000 or $100 000 or $250 000  when we had a surplus  when I thought it was the fiscally responsible thing to do  Other people can disagree  but this is the first time I am being asked to provide a tax cut for people earning over $1 million with this kind of deficit  
But I will say this  I am going to commit myself to trying to find places we can cut  I support the Federal freeze  I support it in appropriations this year  Senator Inouye is taking down on the appropriations level $8 billion below the President's budget  and if we need to go even further  perhaps we can  But we have to be careful where we cut  and I ask people to be rational about this  Do you want to cut Pell grants  I looked at this the other day  I say to the Senator from Vermont  particularly  because of Claiborne Pell  When the Pell grant went into effect  it was a grant to help kids go to school  That is still what it does  But in the 1970s  the Pell grant paid 100 percent of the average 2-year college  It only pays 50 percent of that today  I think I remember it paid almost 60 percent of a 4-year public college  It only pays like 40 percent or less than that today because we have not kept up with it  
A program such as the Pell grant is a powerful tool to lift the middle class  or lift the poor out of poverty and expand the middle class  So when we cut programs  let's be careful to cut the waste  to cut the abuse  but let's not cut the heart out of what we are arguing for effective tools to expand the middle class or we will never get out of this recession  Because I promise you  the few thousand people in this country or few tens of thousands  I don't know how many who make more than $1 million a year are not going to lift this country out of a recession  It is going to be the middle class  And if we don't help them get ahead  if we don't help them get training  this recession will go on for a long time  
Mr  SANDERS  I want to add the idea that when we think about cutting back on education whether it is childcare  primary school  or college we are simply cutting off our noses to spite our faces  The Senator is aware that where  at one time in this country  we used to lead the world in the number of our people who graduated college  we are now falling very significantly  How do you become a great economy if you don't have the scientists  the engineers  the teachers  the professionals out there  and many other countries around the world are having a higher percentage of their high school graduates going to college  That is something we have to address  Anyone who comes forward and says cut education is moving us in exactly the wrong direction  
Ms  LANDRIEU  Exactly  And I am for more accountability  If some of my colleagues on the other side think some of that money is being wasted or we are not getting our bang for the buck  don't come with an across-the-board cut to Pell grants  come with a plan to change it  saying these are the requirements for our universities  You have to graduate 65 percent of the kids who start or you have to have certain benchmarks before you can apply for these loans or for these grants  
This country is at a crossroads  and I know the President and his advisers understand the extraordinary challenges before this country  I hope the Members understand the economic danger  the minefield we are in here  We can't make too many mistakes here  There is no cushion left  There is no surplus left  We are down to below bottom  So when we do big things such as this and this is a big thing  this $980 billion big package  it is almost $1 trillion we need to do it the best way we can do it  We can't do it recklessly or frivolously  We can't do it for ideology  for gosh almighty's sakes  
I wish we could have fought harder for a better package  I have not yet decided how I am going to vote  but I have said if I vote  I am not voting quietly  I may vote yes  I may vote no  but I will vote with a loud voice about what I am concerned about  what I believe my constituents are concerned about  and I will try my best to help them  to support them  and to make the best decisions we can next week  But this has been troubling me  and so I wanted to come to the floor and speak about it  and I thank the Senator from Vermont  
I yield the floor  
Mr  SANDERS  I thank Senator Landrieu very much for coming  and I think she knows that on many issues her views and mine are different  but on this issue  I believe we are speaking for the overwhelming majority of the people  not just of Louisiana and Vermont but all over this country  who cannot understand why we give tax breaks to billionaires to drive up the deficit and the national debt at a time when the deficit and the debt are so large  I want to thank Senator Landrieu very much for her very articulate and heartfelt statements  I appreciate that very much  
Mr  President  I was mentioning a moment ago the great contrast about what is happening in our economy between the people on top and everybody else  I indicated that the top 400 families during the Bush Presidency alone saw their income more than double  at the same time  by the way  as their income tax rates dropped almost in half  So that is what is going on for the people on top  who would make out extremely well under this agreement between the President and the Republican leadership  
But I also talked about what is going on with the middle class and working families of this country  If you can believe it and this is quite amazing since December of 1999 and this was in a Washington Post article in January there has been a zero net job creation a zero net job creation  Middle-income households made less in 2008  when adjusted for inflation  than they did in 1999  and that number is sure to have declined further in 2009  
What does that mean  It means that when you look at a 10-year period and people work very hard in many instances actually  in the vast majority of instances you will have both husbands and wives working and still not making enough money to pay the bills  In fact  they have less money than they used to have  
When I was a kid growing up  the experience was that in the middle class one person I know young people will not believe this  but it is true years ago in the United States  before the great global economy  before robotics  before computers  one person could work 40 hours a week and earn enough money to pay the bills for the family  One person  Today  in Vermont and throughout this country  overwhelmingly you have husbands and wives both working  And in some instances they are working very long hours  But here is the rub  Today  a two-income family has less disposable income than a one-income family did 30 years ago because wages have not kept up with inflation  and because health care costs have soared  the cost of education has soared  housing has soared  and basic necessities have soared  This is a description of a country moving in the wrong direction  
Thirty years ago  a one-income family had more disposable income than a two-income family does today  And there are a lot of reasons for that  Maybe we will touch on them a little bit later  But one of them  in my view  has to do with our disastrous unfettered free trade policy  which has resulted in the shutdown of tens of thousands of factories in this country  Under President Bush alone  we lost some 48 000 factories  We went from 19 million manufacturing jobs to 12 million manufacturing jobs  and in many instances  those were good jobs  
Where did they go  
Some shut down for a variety of reasons  But others shut down because we have trade laws that say you have to be a moron not to shut down in America because if you go to China  go to Vietnam  go to Mexico  go to a developing country  you pay workers there a fraction of what you are paying the workers in America  Why wouldn't you go  Then you bring your products right back into this country  
A couple weeks ago  my wife and I did some Christmas shopping  Frankly we went to couple stores it is very hard to find a product manufactured in the United States of America  You do not have to have a Ph D  in economics to understand we are not going to have a strong economy unless we have a strong manufacturing capability  unless companies are reinvesting in Colorado or Vermont  creating good jobs here  You do not have an economic future when virtually everything you are buying is coming from China or another country  
We are not just talking about low-end products  These are not sneakers or a pair of pants  This is increasingly high-tech stuff  We are forfeiting our future as a great economic nation unless we rebuild our industrial base and unless we create millions and millions of jobs producing the goods and the products we consume  We cannot continue to just purchase products from the rest of the world  
When we talk about the collapse of the middle class  it is important to also recognize the fact  as reported in USA   Today last September  ``the incomes of the young and middle-aged especially men have fallen off a cliff since 2000  leaving many age groups poorer than they were even in the 1970s '' The point being  for young workers  for example  when we had a manufacturing base in America in the 1940s  1950s  1960s  you could graduate high school and go out and get a job in a factory  Was it a glamorous job  No  Was it a hard job  Yes  Was it a dirty job  In some cases  
But if you worked in manufacturing  and especially if you had a union behind you  the likelihood is you earned wages to take your family into the middle class  you had decent health care coverage  and you might even have a strong pension  Where are all those jobs now  During the Bush years alone  we went from 19 million jobs in manufacturing to 12 million jobs  a horrendous loss of manufacturing jobs  If you are a kid today in Colorado or Vermont and you are not of a mind  for whatever reason  to go to college 30 or 40 years ago you could go out  get a job in factory  and make some money  Today  what are your options  You can get a minimum wage job at McDonald's or maybe at Walmart  where benefits are minimal or nonexistent  That is a significant transition of the American economy  
I wish to tell you something else  when we talk about manufacturing  It did not get a whole lot of publicity  but it is worth reporting  The good news is  we have recently seen after the loss of many thousands of jobs in the automobile industry we have seen the auto companies  Chrysler and others  starting to rehire  What I think has not been widely reported is  the wages of the new workers who are being hired are 50 percent of the wages of the older workers in the plant  You are going to have workers working side by side  where an older worker who has been there for years is making $25  $28 an hour  and right next to him a new hire is making $14 an hour  If you understand that the automobile industry was perhaps the gold standard for manufacturing in America  what do you think is going to happen to the wages of blue-collar workers in the future  
If all you can get with a union behind you in automobile manufacturing is $14 an hour today  what are you going to make in Colorado or in Vermont  Are you going to make $10 an hour or $11 an hour  Is that enough money on which to raise a family  Are you going to have any benefits  Unlikely  
That is what happens when your manufacturing base disappears and that  to a significant degree  in my view  is a result of a disastrous trade policy  I have to tell you and I think in hindsight most people agree I was right when I was in the House and all the corporations in the world were telling us how great NAFTA would be  free trade with Mexico  I did not buy it  I was right  They would say  Oh  it is going to be even better  We will have free trade with China  Think about how large China is and all the American products they are going to buy over there to create all kinds of jobs in the United States  I never believed it for a moment  
I will tell you a story  I was in China a number of years ago and as part of a congressional delegation we went to visit Walmart in China  The Walmart store  amazingly enough  looked a lot like Walmart in America different products  but it looked like the same style  You walk up and down the aisles and you see all these American products  I remember Wilson basketballs  Procter & Gamble soap products different products there for the Chinese  but a lot of the products were American products  They looked pretty familiar  
I asked the guy who was there with us who was  I believe  the head of Walmart Asia the guy in charge of all the Walmarts in Asia I asked him a simple question  Tell me  how many of these American company products are actually manufactured in the United States  
He was a little bit sheepish and a little bit hesitant and he said  Well  about 1 percent  Obviously  what everybody knew  it is a lot cheaper for the American companies to set up plants in China  hire Chinese workers at 50 cents an hour  75 cents an hour  whatever it is  and have them build the product for the Chinese markets than it is to pay American workers $15 an hour  $20 an hour  provide health insurance  deal with the union  deal with the environment  That is not a great revelation  I think anybody could have figured that one out  But the big money interests around here pushed it and Congress and President Clinton  at that time  signed it and we were off and running  
When we look at why the middle class is in the shape it is and it is important to make sure everybody understands it because one of the things that happens in this world  it is human nature I suppose  is that people feel very guilty and responsible if they are not taking care of their families  Right now we know  with unemployment so high this is not just cold statistics we are throwing out  These are people who not only were earning an income that supported their families  they had a sense of worth  Every human being wants to be productive  They want to produce something  They want to be part of something  They want to go to work  earn a paycheck  bring it home  You feel good about that  
Do you know what it does to somebody's sense of human worth when suddenly you are sitting home watching the TV  you can't go out and earn a living  It destroys people  People be come alcoholic  People commit suicide  People have mental breakdowns because they are not utilizing their skills  They are no longer being a productive member of society  That is what unemployment is about  
I think one of the reasons unemployment is so high  one of the reasons the middle class is collapsing  has a lot to do with these disastrous trade policies  I have to tell you  as we have been talking about all day long  these policies  these tax breaks  all this stuff emanates from corporate leaders whose sense of responsibility is such that they want themselves to become richer  they want more and more profits for their company  but they could care less about the needs of the American people  
I remember there was one CEO of a large  one of our largest American corporations  and he said  When I look at the future of General Electric  I see China  China  China  and China  By the way  we ended up bailing out that particular corporation  He didn't look to China to get bailed out  he looked to the taxpayers of this country  
But the word has to get out to corporate America  they are going to have to start reinvesting in the United States of America  They are going to have to start building the products and the goods the American people need rather than run all over in search of cheap labor  That is an absolute imperative if we are going to turn this economy around  
According to a Boston Globe article published last year let 
me quote what they say  Again  I am trying to document here what is happening to the working class of America because I do not want individual workers  somebody who may be hearing this on the TV  the radio  to say  It is my fault  There is something wrong with me because I can't go out and get a job  
You are not alone  The entire middle class is collapsing  Our economy is shedding millions and millions of jobs  I know there are people out there trying hard to find work  but that work is just not there  That is why we have to rebuild the economy and create jobs  This is what the Boston Globe said last year  ``The recession has been more like a depression for blue-collar workers  .....'' 
This is an important point to be made here  When we talk about the economy we kind of lump everybody together  That is wrong  The truth is right now in the economy people on top are doing very well  The unemployment rate for upper income people is very low  They are doing OK  That as opposed  as this Boston Globe article points out  to what is happening to blue collar workers  ``The recession has been more like a depression for blue-collar workers  who are losing jobs much more quickly than the nation as a whole  .....'' 
This is the working class of America  `` ..... the Nation's blue-collar industries have slashed one in six jobs since 2007  .....'' Let me repeat that  It is just astronomical  a fact  
..... the nation's blue-collar industries [manufacturing] have slashed one in six jobs since 2007  compared with about one in 20 for all industries  leaving scores of the unemployed competing for the rare job opening in construction or manufacturing  with many unlikely to work in those fields again  
Never  
Up to 70 percent of up employed blue-collar workers have lost jobs permanently  meaning their old jobs won't be there when the economy recovers  
That is the Boston Globe  last year  When we talk about the economy  what we have to do is understand that blue-collar workers  middle-class  young workers are hurting very much  In the context  again  of the debate we are now having  the discussion of whether we should approve the agreement reached between the President and the Republicans on taxes  the idea of not significantly investing in our economy but  rather  giving tens of billions of dollars to the very rich in more tax breaks makes no sense to many of us  
When we talk about why people are angry  why people  when asked the question by pollsters  Do you think America is moving in the right direction  and overwhelmingly they think not  let me tell you why they think not  This is just during the Presidency of President Bush from 2001 through 2008  During that period alone and by the way  the pain is certainly continuing right now  I do not mean to suggest otherwise  During those 8 years of Bush  over 8 million Americans slipped out of the middle class and into poverty  Today  nearly 40 million Americans are living in poverty; 7 8 million Americans lost their health insurance  and that is continuing  
A recent study came out and suggests that the uninsured now are about 50 million Americans  Fifty million Americans have no health insurance now  We hope health insurance reform will make a dent on that  I think it will  But as of today  without the major provisions of health care reform being implemented  50 million Americans are without any health insurance  
During that period and we have not talked about this a whole lot there is another thing going on in the economy for the working class  Years and years ago  if you worked in a manufacturing plant  you had a union  you stood a reasonable chance of having a pension a pension  During the Bush years  3 2 million workers lost their pensions  and about half of American workers in the private sector have no pension coverage whatsoever  The idea today of having a defined pension plan significantly paid for by your employer is going the way of the dinosaur  That is just not there anymore  
Workers are more and more dependent on Social Security  which has been there for 75 years  which we have to protect and demand that it will be there another 75 years because right now millions of workers are losing their pensions  I mean  I am throwing these statistics out  and the reason I am doing that is I want people to appreciate that if you are hurting now  stop being ashamed  It is not  yeah  we can all do better  Every one of us can do better  But you are in an economy which is contracting  especially for the middle class and working families  
According to an article in USA Today  from the year 2 000 to 2007  middle-class men women have done better middle-class men experienced an 11 2-percent drop in their incomes a reduction of $7 700 after adjusting for inflation  Middle-class women in this age group saw a 4 8-percent decline in their incomes as well  So they did pretty badly  but the men did even worse  So what we are seeing is an understanding of why people are angry and why people think this country is moving in the wrong direction  
I think most people understand that today our country is experiencing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s  It is important to say that because  again  it is hard enough when you do not have a job  when you do not have income  when your dignity and self-respect are declining  but I don't want people to be banging their own heads against the wall blaming themselves for all of the problems  Something has gone on in the Nation as a whole  You are not in this alone  When we talk about working-class families all across the country seeing a decline in their income  it is not because people are lazy  it is not because people do not work hard  it is not because people are not trying to find jobs  What we have is an economy which is rotting in the middle  and we have to change the economy  
If there is anything we can say about the American people  we work hard  We  in fact  work longer hours than do the people of any other country  industrialized country  on Earth  We are not a lazy people  We are a hard-working people  If the jobs are there  people will take them  If people have to work 60 hours a week or 70 hours a week  that is what they will do  But we have to rebuild this economy  We do not need tax breaks for billionaires  We need to create jobs for the middle class of this country so that we can put people back to work  
Let me take a few minutes to discuss how we got to where we are today and  in my view  what policies we need to move this country forward to create the kinds of jobs we desperately need  
Let's take a quick look back to where we were in January of 2009 it seems like a long time ago but just a couple of years ago  That was the last month of the administration of President Bush  In that month  we lost over 700 000 jobs  That is an absolutely incredible number  In fact  during the last 6 months of the Bush Presidency  we lost over 3 1/2 million jobs  all of which was caused by the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street  
Our gross domestic product  which is the total sum of all our economy produces  had gone down by nearly 7 percent during the fourth quarter of 2008  That was the biggest decline in more than a quarter century  Some $5 trillion of America's wealth evaporated in a 12-week period  as the people in Vermont and all over this country saw the value of their homes  retirement savings  and stocks plummet  
I want to say just one word again about Wall Street greed because I think for a variety of reasons we just do not talk about it enough  What you had was a situation in which a small number of folks at the head of huge financial institutions  through their greed  through the development of very reckless policies  through illegal behavior  through pushing out financial instruments which turned out in some cases to be worthless as a result of all of that  they plunged this country into the worst recession we have seen since the Great Depression from January  That is at the end of the Bush Administration  
It is very important to understand that the Wall Street crisis took us over the wall in terms of precipitating the severe recession we are in  but we have to remember that during those 8 years  as I mentioned earlier  the middle class was also shrinking  So it was not  Oh my goodness  everything is going great  Then you got the Wall Street disaster  and now we are in the midst of a terrible recession  This trend of a middle-class collapse went on long before Bush precipitated significantly during the Bush years  but it went on before as well  not just during the Bush years  
Over the 8-year period of President Bush  from 2001 to 2009  we lost 600 000 private sector jobs  We lost 600 000 private sector jobs  and only 1 million net new jobs were created  all of them in the government sector  So for my friends  my Republican colleagues  to tell us that we need more tax breaks for the very rich because that is going to create jobs that is what trickle-down economics is all about I would say to them  You had your chance  It failed  In case you don't know  losing 600 000 private sector jobs in 8 years is not good  That is very  very bad  That is an economic policy that has failed  We don't need to look at that movie again  We saw it  It stunk  It was a bad movie  Bad economic policy  More tax breaks for the rich is not what our economy needs  In fact  what every economist will tell you is that is the least effective way to create jobs  
During the Bush era  median income dropped by nearly $2 200  That means that a family in the middle  over an 8-year period  saw their income drop by $2 200 during the 8 years of Bush  
I say all of these things just to tell you that we are not where we are today just because of the Wall Street crisis  That took us over the cliff  That made a very bad situation much  much worse  But it has been going on for a long time  It has gone on before Bush  It has gone on after Bush  
During the 8 years of Bush  over 8 million Americans slipped out of the middle class and into poverty  We don't talk about poverty in America anymore  We don't talk about the homelessness in America very much anymore  Trust me  it is there  It is three blocks away from where I am speaking right now  a very large homeless shelter  It is in small towns in Vermont where people tell me that for the first time they are seeing more and more families with kids needing emergency shelter because they can't afford housing  In Vermont  a lot of people have low-wage jobs making 10 bucks an hour  and it is hard to find a decent apartment or pay a mortgage on $10 an hour  That is true certainly all over this country  Homelessness is going up  
During the Bush years  nearly 8 million Americans lost their health insurance  One of the issues I will talk about in a little while is health care  It is related to everything  We are the only country in the industrialized world that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right of citizenship  According to Harvard University  45 000 Americans will die this year because they lack health insurance and are not getting to a doctor when they should  
During the Bush administration  5 million manufacturing jobs disappeared  as companies shut down plants in the United States and moved to China  Mexico  Vietnam  and other low-wage countries  As I mentioned earlier  it is profoundly important to understand what is going on in America  In 2000  we had over 17 000 manufacturing jobs in this country  By 2008  we had less than 12 000  That is 17 000 to 12 000 in 8 years  That is the loss of 5 million manufacturing jobs a 29-percent reduction and the fewest number of manufacturing jobs since the beginning of World War II  
Under President Bush  our trade deficit with China more than tripled and the overall trade deficit nearly doubled  
Again  the point I am making now in the context of this agreement is that we need agreements now that do not give tax breaks to millionaires or billionaires  that do not lower the tax rates or the estate tax  which is applicable only to the top three-tenths of 1 percent  We need an agreement that rebuilds our infrastructure  rebuilds our manufacturing base  and creates the millions of good-paying jobs the American people desperately want  
Again  I think the point has to be made and I have to make it over and over that when you look at the economy  it is one thing to say everybody is hurting  You know  sometimes that happens  A terrible hurricane comes through and knocks down everybody's home  Well  the hurricane that has hit America for the last 10  20 years has not impacted everybody; it has impacted the working class  it has impacted the middle class  The people on top are doing better than they ever were  Our friends on Wall Street whose greed and illegal behavior caused this recession are now making more money than they ever did  after being bailed out by the middle class of this country  
During the Bush years  the wealthiest 400 Americans saw their incomes more than double  Do you really think that after seeing a doubling of their incomes under the Bush years  these people are in desperate need of another million-dollar-a-year tax break  In 2007  the 400 top income earners in this country made an average of $345 million in 1 year  That is a pretty piece of change  That is the average  $345 million  In terms of wealth  as opposed to income  the wealthiest 400 Americans saw an increase in their wealth of some $400 billion during the Bush years  Imagine that  During an 8-year period  the top 400 wealthiest people each saw an increase  on average  of $1 billion apiece  Together  these 400 families have a collective net of $1 27 trillion  Does anybody in America really believe these guys need another tax break so that our kids and our grandchildren can pay more in taxes because the national debt has gone up  I do not think most Americans believe that  That is why  in my view  most Americans are not supporting this agreement  
Let me also say that when we look at what is going on around the rest of the world  what we have to appreciate is that in the United States today again  this is not something we can be proud of; it is something we have to address we have the most unequal distribution of wealth and income of any other country on Earth  
I remember talking not so long ago to somebody from Scandinavia  I think it was Finland  He was saying  Of course  we have rich people in our country  but there is a level at which they would become embarrassed  
America now has a situation where the CEOs of large corporations make 300 times more than their workers  In many other countries  everybody wants to be rich  but there is a limit  You can't become a billionaire stepping over children sleeping on the street  That is not what this country is supposed to be about  Enough should be enough  
The top 1 percent today earns 23 5 percent of all income  In the 1970s  that number was 8 percent  In the 1990s  it was approximately 16 percent  Now it is 23 5 percent  So the people on top are getting a bigger and bigger chunk of all income  Furthermore  it is not only the top 1 percent  there are economists who ask  You think the top 1 percent are doing well  It is really the top one-tenth of 1 percent  If you can believe this  the top one-tenth of 1 percent and I don't know how many people that is  you can do the arithmetic  300 million into one-tenth of 1 percent took in 11 percent of total income  according to the latest data  One-tenth of 1 percent earned 11 percent of all income in America  
In the 1970s  the top 1 percent only made something like 8 percent of total income  In the 1980s it rose to 10 to 14 percent  In the late 1990s  it was 15 percent to 19 percent  In 2005 it passed 21 percent  And in 2010  the top 1 percent receive 23 percent of all the income earned in this country  
People should be mindful of this fact  The last time that type of income disparity took place was in 1928  I think we all know what happened in 1929  That is the point Senator Landrieu was making a while back  What she understands  quite correctly  is if working people  the vast majority of the people  don't have the income to spend money to buy products and goods and services  we can't create the jobs  If all of the money or a big chunk of the money ends up with a few people on top  there is a limit to how many limousines you can have and how many homes you can have and how many yachts you can have  So when we hit a situation where so few have so much  it is not only a moral issue  it is also an economic issue  
A strong and growing middle class goes out  spends money  and creates jobs  Grossly unequal distribution of income and wealth creates more economic shrinkage and loss of jobs because people just don't have the disposable income to go out and buy and create jobs  
To add insult to injury in terms of this agreement negotiated by the President and Republicans  while the very wealthiest people became much wealthier and the deficit soared and under President Bush the national debt almost doubled what else happened  The tax rates for the very rich went down  The rich got richer; tax rates went down  This was a result not only of the tax breaks for the rich initiated during the Bush administration but also  quite frankly  tax policy that took place before President Bush  The result is that from 1992 to 2007  from the latest statistics we have  the effective Federal tax rate what people really pay for the top 400 income earners was cut almost in half  So these cry babies  these multimillionaires and billionaires  these people who are making out like bandits  they are crying and crying and crying  but the effective tax rate for the top 400 income earners was cut almost in half from 1992 to 2007  
The point that needs to be made is  when is enough enough  That is the essence of what we are talking about  Greed  in my view  is like a sickness  It is like an addiction  We know people who are on heroin  They can't stop  They destroy their lives  They need more and more heroin  There are people who can't stop smoking  They have problems with nicotine  They get addicted to cigarettes  It costs them their health  People have problems with food  We all have our share of addictions  But I would hope that these people who are worth hundreds of millions of dollars will look around them and say  There is something more important in life than the richest people becoming richer when we have the highest rate of childhood poverty in the industrialized world  Maybe they will understand that they are Americans  part of a great nation which is in trouble today  Maybe they have to go back to the Bible  whatever they believe in  and understand there is virtue in sharing  in reaching out; that you can't get it all  
I think this is an issue we have to stay on and stay on and stay on  This greed  this reckless  uncontrollable greed is almost like a disease which is hurting this country terribly  How can anybody be proud to say they are a multimillionaire and are getting a huge tax break and one-quarter of the kids in this country are on food stamps  How can one be proud of that  I don't know  
It is not only income  it is wealth  The top 1 percent owns more wealth than the bottom 90 percent  During the Bush years  the wealthiest 400 Americans saw their wealth increase by some $400 billion  How much is enough  
All of these things are related to the agreement the President and Republicans worked out because we are all concerned about the national debt and deficit  In terms of the Federal budget  when President Bush first took office  he inherited a $236 billion surplus in 2001 and a projected 10-year surplus of $5 6 trillion  That is what Senator Landrieu was discussing  But then some things happened  We all know that 9/11 was not his fault  but what happened is  we went to war in Afghanistan  We went to war in Iraq  The war in Iraq was the fault of President Bush  something I certainly did not support  nor do I think most Americans supported  The war in Iraq  by the time our last veteran is taken care of  will probably end up costing us something like $3 trillion  adding enormously to our national debt  
So when we talk about Iraq  it is not only the terrible loss of life that our soldiers and the Iraqi people have experienced  let's not forget what it has done to the deficit and the national debt  We did not pay for the war in Iraq  We just put it on the credit card  
President Bush gave out $700 billion in tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans  Where was the offset  There was none  He gave them tax breaks  That is it  It adds to the national debt  
The President and Republicans supported a $400 billion Medicare Part D prescription drug program  I have always believed we need a strong prescription drug program for seniors  But the program that was passed was written by the pharmaceutical industry  written by the insurance companies  and is nowhere near as cost-effective as it could be  As the President undoubtedly knows  we are not even negotiating prescription drug prices with the drug companies  a great expense and great cost to the American people  where drug prices are now much more expensive under Medicare Part D than they are in terms of what the Veterans' Administration or the Department of Defense purchases  So we passed that  unpaid for  Great idea  Just another $400 billion prescription drug program unpaid for  
Then we bailed out Wall Street  The original cost was $700 billion  A lot of that has been paid back  but there is expense there as well  
So we add all these things together  normal governmental growth  and it turns out that the Bush administration turned a $236-billion-a-year surplus into a $1 3-trillion-a-year deficit  More or less  that is where we are right now  In fact  the national debt nearly doubled under President Bush  going from $5 7 trillion to $10 6 trillion in 2009 and now we are at $13 7 trillion  borrowing huge sums of money from China and other countries in order to maintain our existence  That is where we are  
Have we been seeing in recent years some improvements in the economy  We sure have  There has been some job growth  Nowhere near enough  But we are surely not losing 700 000 jobs a year  We are seeing some growth  But we need to do much better  
That takes me back to an issue I feel strongly about and one on which I want to say a few words  In this agreement the President negotiated with Republicans  there is a substantial sum of money going into various types of business tax breaks  The theory  which has certainly some validity  is that these business tax breaks will create jobs  The problem is that right now  businesses  the large corporations at least  are sitting on a huge bundle of money already that they are not spending  The reason they are not investing that money is they perceive that working families don't have the money to buy their products and services  
In saying this  I am not alone  I think most economists agree there is a far more effective way we can create jobs rather than just a number of tax breaks going to businesses  I touched on this point before  I want to get into a little bit more detail  
For this I am indebted to a very fine book written by an old friend of mine  Arianna Huffington  The title of her book is ``Third World America '' She used that word because basically the theme of her book is  if we do not get our act together in terms of infrastructure  in terms of education  in terms of health care  that is where we are headed  We are headed in the direction of being a Third World nation  
She has an interesting chapter which deals with one very important part of what is going on in America  and that is the crumbling of our infrastructure  She writes  
From 1980 to 2005  the miles traveled by automobiles increased 94 percent for trucks mileage increased 105 percent yet there was only a 3 5 percent increase in highway lane miles  
More and more cars  more and more traveling  We are not building roads  
But you don't need these numbers to know that our roads are badly congested  
Anybody who lives around Washington knows our roads are congested  It takes hours to get to work sometimes  
You see it and experience it every day  
According to the American Society of Civil Engineers infrastructure report card and this is where we should be investing  not tax breaks for the rich Americans spend 4 2 billion hours a year stuck in traffic  Think about that  4 2 billion hours a year stuck in traffic  at a cost of $78 billion a year  Think about all of the pollution  all of the greenhouse gas emissions  all of the frustration  all of the anxiety  all of the road rage  People are stuck on roads because our transportation system is totally inadequate  our roads  our public transportation  
She then makes another interesting point  When we talk about automobile accidents  what do we usually think  We think somebody is driving recklessly  maybe they are drunk  Those are serious issues  But she writes  In studying car crashes across the country  the Transportation Construction Coalition determined that badly maintained or managed roads are responsible for $217 billion a year in car crashes  far more than headline-grabbing  alcohol-related accidents or speed-related pileups  
In other words  if you want to know why we are seeing automobile crashes  the issue of bad roads is even more significant than drunk drivers or people who are reckless drivers  I can remember I think everybody has the same story I was driving on a road in Vermont  and  whoops  there was a huge pothole  and the car went into it  It cost a few hundred dollars to repair the car  So we are spending as a nation billions of dollars repairing our cars because our roads are not in good shape  When there is a traffic jam  people are emitting all kinds of greenhouse gas emissions  You are wasting gas  You are wasting money  If we invested in our transportation system  we could go a long way to addressing that  
When we talk about transportation and  by the way  again  I bring this issue up because  in the bill agreed to by the President and the Republican leadership  to the best of my knowledge  not one penny not one penny is going into infrastructure  which  to me  does not make any sense at all  
Again  Arianna Huffington writes  
America's railway system is speeding down the tracks in reverse  It is one of the few technologies that has actually regressed over the past 80 years  
Regressed  I am not talking about China  where they are building all these high-speed rail lines  Our rail situation in terms of the amount of time it takes to go from location one to location two has actually gotten longer  
She writes  
Tom Vanderbilt of Slate com  
Which is a very good Web site  
came across some pre-World War II train timetables and made a startling discovery  Many train rides in the 1930s  40s  and 50s took less time than those journeys would take today  
Can you imagine that  In the 1930s  1940s  and 1950s  people were able to get on a train and get to their destination in less time than is the case today  
For instance  in 1934  the Burlington Zephyr would get you from Chicago to Denver  
From Chicago to Denver  
in around 13 hours  The same trip takes 18 hours today  
I do not know if the Presiding Office is familiar with the Burlington Zephyr  which is a train that goes from Chicago to Denver  but what this writer is pointing out is that in 1934 it took 13 hours to make that trip  Do you know how long it takes today  It takes 18 hours  So we are moving in the wrong direction  
I know in Vermont I do not have any statistics right in front of me but I can tell you I believe very strongly it takes longer to get from the southern part of the State to the northern part of the State than it used to  and the frequency of the trips is less than they used to be  
The trip from Chicago to Minneapolis via the Olympian Hiawatha  in the 1950s  took about 4 1/2 hours  Today  via Amtrak's train  the journey takes more than 8 hours  
It used to be 4 1/2 . So in terms of our public transportation  not only are we neglecting  not only are we not moving forward  we are actually moving backwards  
At the moment  the only high-speed train in the United States is Amtrak's Acela  which travels the Washington  New York  Boston line  
And she writes  
And I use the term ``high-speed'' very loosely  While in theory the trains have a peak speed of 150 miles per hour  the average speed on that train is just about 71 miles per hour  
Once again  I read some statistics before  pointing out that China is building thousands and thousands of miles of high-speed rail  And here in the United States we are moving backwards  It is taking us a longer time for various train rides than used to be the case  
But it is not just trains  It is not just our roads  It is not just our bridges  
Well  it is also our bridges  Let me say a word on bridges  I think we all remember 4 years ago  I think it was  the terrible tragedy in the Minneapolis area  when one of their major bridges collapsed and a number of people lost their lives  That got the front-page headlines all over this country  I know in Vermont we closed down bridges  They are not safe to travel  
According to the Department of Transportation  1 in 4 of America's bridges is either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete  The numbers are even worse when it comes to bridges in urban areas  where 1 in 3 bridges is deficient no small matter given the high levels of passengers and freight traffic in our Nation's cities  
So a huge amount of traffic in urban areas one in three bridges is deficient  and in rural areas such as Vermont  one in four  
How are these bridges going to be rebuilt  It is likely not going to be done by local and State governments that right now are experiencing enormous economic crises  If it is going to be done  it is going to have to be done here at the Federal level  
I have to say that in Vermont we saw some significant improvements as a result of the stimulus package  In fact  in Vermont  recently  we have put more money in rebuilding our roads and bridges with very good success  I think the people of Vermont see the difference  In the last couple years  directly as a result of the stimulus package  we have made significant improvements on a number of bridges but nowhere near enough  
The point I want to make is that with our infrastructure collapsing  with the American Society of Civil Engineers suggesting we need to spend $2 2 trillion in the next 5 years just to maintain where we are  we have an agreement before us which puts zero dollars in infrastructure  According to this book  
We need to invest $850 billion over the next 50 years to get all of America's bridges into good shape  
Trust me  we are not coming anywhere near that right now  
But it is not just our roads  It is not just our public transportation  It is not just our bridges  When we talk about infrastructure  we also have to talk about dams  
On March 16  2006  the Ka Loko Dam in Kilauea  Hawaii  collapsed  and seven people died when the Ka Loko Dam breached after weeks of heavy rain  sending 1 6 million tons of water downstream  
Dams are a vital part of America's infrastructure  They help provide for drinking  irrigation  and agriculture  and generate much needed power  and often offer protection from floods  Yet our dams are growing old  There are more than 85 000 dams in America  and the average age is 51 years  At the same time  more and more people are moving into developments located below dams that require significantly greater safety standards  But we have had a hard time keeping up with the increase in the so-called high-hazard dams  Indeed  we are falling further and further behind  
So the point here is  we have a major agreement  People are concerned about creating jobs  We are investing zero in our infrastructure  and dams are a very important part of our infrastructure  as are levees  And I suspect Senator Landrieu  who was here a little while ago  would have something to say about levees  
All right  So we are talking about an infrastructure which is collapsing  We are talking about China investing far more in terms of their GDP into infrastructure improvement than we are  We are talking about being in the midst of a major recession  where we desperately want to grow jobs  and yet this proposal does not add one cent into our infrastructure  
Now  again  I am going back to the very good book written by Arianna Huffington called ``Third World America '' She writes  
As bad as America's sewers  roads  bridges  dams  and water power systems are  they pale in comparison to the crisis we are facing in our schools  I am not talking about the physical state of our dilapidated public school buildings  although the National Education Association estimates that it would take $322 billion to bring America's school buildings into good repair  
I have been in schools in Vermont and elsewhere which were old and crumbling  and I have been in schools which are new and state of the art  I think anyone who has seen the contrast in terms of the attitude of the students in those types of schools will understand it is important to give these kids good places in which to learn and to grow  It means a lot to them when they see a building that is new that has state-of-the-art equipment  as opposed to one that is crumbling  It suggests to them what we as a society feel about them  
Arianna Huffington writes  
Nothing is quickening our descent into Third World status faster than our resounding failure to properly educate our children  This failure has profound consequences for our future  both at home and as we look to compete with the rest of the world in the global economy  
She writes  
Historically  education has been the great equalizer  
That is certainly the case  
That has been the incredible virtue of our public school system  
What we have taken as kids  who spent my father did not graduate from high school  My mother did  That was it  
--and given millions of young people the opportunity to get a good education in school and be able to go to college and use their potential  The springboard to the middle class and beyond has been education  It was a promise we made to all of our people  
What we as a nation said is  regardless of your income  we are going to provide you with the best possible education in order to succeed in life  That is something extraordinary  that no matter what your income is  we are going to provide you with a great education  As a kid  I went to public schools  and I did have a very good education  
But something has gone in recent years terribly wrong  and we have slipped further and further behind many other countries  Among 30 developed countries ranked by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  
That is the OECD  
the United States ranked 25th in math and 21st in science  
So 25th in math  21st in science  
Even the top 10 percent of the American students our best and brightest ranked only 24th in the world in math literacy  
There was another study  I think probably just a more updated OECD study  that came out just the other day  reported in the New York Times  where kids in Shanghai were leading the world in these types of tests as compared to our own students  They are studied  They have better schools  better teachers  more investments in their education  And there is a culture there  There is a culture  It is not fair to blame the kids  
Does anyone seriously believe in the United States of America we take intellectual development seriously  I was reading today I do not remember the guy's name  who it was a basketball player or a baseball player just signing a contract for untold tens of millions of dollars  Yet you have teachers starting off at $30 000  $32 000  Is anyone going to suggest in a serious way we reward people who become childcare workers or teachers  
We have childcare workers taking care of little kids which may be the most important job in our society because there is the brain development that takes place between zero and 3 that has a large part to do with what a human being becomes people leaving early childhood education in order to move up the economic ladder and get a job at McDonald's because pay is so low  benefits are so low  What are we doing as a nation  
She writes  
A National Assessment of Educational Progress report found that just 33 percent of U S  fourth graders and 32 percent eighth graders were proficient in reading  
Et cetera  et cetera  et cetera  
So I think her point is that if we are not going to become a Third World nation  we have to start investing in this country in our physical infrastructure  in our human infrastructure  and in our educational infrastructure  
Let me give you some examples of what this means in real terms  Today  unemployment in our country the official unemployment rate is 9 8 percent  For those without a high school diploma  it is 15 6 percent  compared to 5 6 percent for college graduates  Mr  President  67 percent of high school graduates do not have enough of the skills required for success in college and the 21st century workforce  
As many as 170 000 high school graduates each year are prepared to go on to college but cannot afford that  Let me repeat that  About 170 000 young people in this country  who graduate high school  who want to go to college  are unable to do it because they cannot afford it  
Are we nuts  What are we doing in wasting the extraordinary intellectual potential of all of these young people  
What we are saying to them is because you don't have the money and because college is so expensive  and because our Federal Government is more busy giving tax breaks to billionaires and fighting two wars  we are not investing in you  
That makes no sense at all  When you invest in your kids  you are investing in the future of America  They are America  And if they are not well educated  how are they going to become productive members of society  How are we going to compete against China and Europe and other countries around the world that are investing in education  
Here is something we don't talk about enough  The fastest growing occupations are those that require higher levels of education and greater technical competency  So we have a problem it is true in Vermont and it is true all over the country which is we have jobs out there  good jobs  and those jobs cannot be filled because our young people don't have the job skills to fill them  How absurd is that  
I remember there was a piece in one of the papers  I think it was in Ohio  where after the worst of the recession  a lot of layoffs I think it was Ohio they were beginning to hire workers and these were for sophisticated  high-tech jobs  They brought workers in and brought them in and brought them in  and they couldn't come up with the number of workers they needed to fill the jobs they had  What does that say about our educational system  
Data from Alliance for Excellent Education  2009  1 800 Vermont dropouts cost the State $459 million of lost lifetime earnings for the State and $19 4 million in health care costs  In other words  what everybody understands is if you don't invest in your young people  they are not going to become productive  tax-paying workers  As often as not  they will get involved in self-destructive activity drugs  crime  whatever  They will end up in jail  and we end up spending tens of thousands of dollars keeping them in jail rather than seeing them out there as productive members of society contributing their fair share in taxes  
The Urban Institute says we can reduce child poverty which I mentioned earlier is the highest in the industrialized world by 35 percent if we provide childcare subsidies to families with income less than 50 percent of State median  
This is an issue I feel very strongly about  It is  to me  beyond comprehension that in Vermont and throughout this country  it is extremely difficult for working-class families to find affordable  good quality childcare  We are not back in the 1950s where daddy went to work and mommy stayed home taking care of the kids  Mom is at work as well  And we have families all over this country middle-class  working-class families saying  I cannot find quality childcare  We are uncomfortable leaving our 2-year-old or 3-year-old  We can't find childcare at a rate we can afford  
In this area  again  we are far behind many other countries around the world  Kids who do not get intellectually challenging early childhood education  kids who do not get the emotional support they need from zero to 3 to 4  will enter school already quite behind other kids  Then  5 years later  10 years later  they will be dropping out of school and they will be doing drugs and they will be ending up in jail at great expense  How long does it take us to understand that investing in our children  our youngest children  is enormously important for our country  It is a good investment  It is much better to invest in childcare than in keeping people locked up in jails  
Seventy-five percent of American youth who apply to the military are ineligible to serve because of low cognitive capacities  criminal records  or obesity  This is quite unbelievable  Now we are not only talking about not being able to compete internationally because we are not bringing forth the kind of educated people we need  because of the inadequacies of our schools and childcare and so forth this almost becomes a national security issue  if you like  Seventy-five percent of American youth who apply to the military are ineligible to serve because of low cognitive capacities  criminal records  or obesity  It gives me no pride  no happiness  to bring forth these statistics  But as a nation  we are going to have to grasp these things  Either we can ignore these things  either we can run away from reality  put our heads underneath the carpet  or we can say we are not going to allow America to become a Third World nation  that we are going to turn this country around  
But we are not going to turn the country around unless we rethink our priorities  One of our priorities cannot be more tax breaks for the richest people in this country  
From the 1960s to 2006  the United States fell from first to 18th out of 24 industrialized nations in high school graduation rates  What happens in today's economy if a kid does not graduate high school  If my memory is correct  about 30 percent of our kids and I know these figures are fuzzy because it is hard to determine who is dropping out and who is not  but my understanding is about 30 percent of our kids drop out of high school  What happens to those kids  Where do they go  How many of them end up in jail  How many of them do drugs  As a nation  I think we can do a lot better than that  We should not have gone from first to 18th out of 24 industrialized nations in high school graduation rates  Dropouts are eight times more likely to be incarcerated  In other words  when kids fail in school  they are going to end up in jail eight times more likely  Eighty-two percent of those in prison are high school dropouts  
I will tell my colleagues a funny experience  I was in Burlington last week  I met this fellow  He came up and was chatting with me  He said  I just got out of jail  What struck me is he was a well educated young man  He was very articulate  I suspect he had gone to college  What struck me is how rare that is  as the statistics aptly demonstrate  The people who end up in jail overwhelmingly are high school dropouts  people who don't have the education to make it in the world  
When we talk about the need to substantially increase funding for early childhood education  we should understand that State-funded  pre-K programs currently serve 24 percent of 4-year-olds and 4 percent of 3-year-olds  In other words  there are millions of families who would like to see their kids be able to access good quality childcare but can't find that in their States again  in contrast to giving tax breaks to billionaires who don't need it and in some cases are not even asking for it  The younger the age of investment in human capital  the higher the rate of return on that investment  If society invests early enough  it can raise cognitive and socio-emotional levels and the health of disadvantaged kids  One doesn't need to be a psychologist to understand that  If kids get off to a good start in life  if they have the intellectual support  the intellectual development  and the emotional support  those kids are much more likely to do well in school  much less likely to drop out  much less likely to be a burden on society  much less likely to end up in jail  much less likely to do drugs  et cetera  This is an investment we should be making  
I wish to get back for a moment to the agreement the President made with the Republican leadership and why I think it is a bad agreement and why I believe we can do much better  The way we are going to improve this agreement is when millions of people all over this country say  wait a second  Wait a second  This was an agreement reached behind closed doors  There are Members in the House and the Senate who didn't know about the agreement  What about the average American out there  I wonder how many people believe it makes a lot of sense  with a $13 7 trillion national debt  to be giving huge tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country  
I have to tell my colleagues  the calls in my office are coming 98  99 percent to 1 against these agreements  People think we can do better and our job is to do better  The way we do better is when people all over this country stand up and say  Wait a minute  Congress  Your job is to represent the middle class  to represent our kids  and not to represent the wealthiest people in this country  
I mentioned earlier  I think certainly one of the major objections to this agreement is that it provides tens of billions of dollars to the wealthiest people in this country at a time when the rich are already doing phenomenally well and at a time when the wealthiest people have already experienced huge tax breaks  I think most people think that does not make sense  Let me give an example  not to pick on particular individuals that is not my goal but so we know this  
According to the Citizens for Tax Justice  if the Bush tax breaks for the top 2 percent are extended  these are some of the people who will benefit and what kind of benefits they will receive  Rupert Murdoch  the CEO of News Corporation  would receive a $1 3 million tax break next year  Mr  Murdoch is a billionaire  Do we really think he needs that  Jamie Dimon  the head of JPMorgan Chase  whose bank got a $29 billion bailout from the Federal Reserve  will receive a $1 1 million tax break  Trust me  Jamie Dimon  the head of JPMorgan Chase  is doing just fine  Vikram Pandit  the CEO of Citigroup  the bank that got a $50 billion bailout  would receive $785 000 in tax breaks  Ken Lewis  the former CEO of Bank of America a bank that got a $45 billion bailout the guy is already fabulously wealthy would receive a $713 000 tax break  The CEO of Wells Fargo these are the largest banks in America; the CEOs of these banks are already making huge compensation  John Stumpf  who is the CEO of Wells Fargo  would receive a $318 000 tax break every single year  The CEO of Morgan Stanley  John Mack  whose bank got a $10 billion bailout  would receive a $926 000 a year tax break  The CEO of Aetna  Ronald Williams  would receive a tax break worth $875 000  
I contrast that  as I did earlier  to the fact that 2 days ago  the Presiding Officer and I and a total of 53 Members of the Senate said  You know  maybe we should provide a $250 check this year to seniors on Social Security and to disabled vets because they haven't gotten a COLA for 2 years a $250 check  People making $14 000  $15 000 a year desperately need a little bit of help  We couldn't get one Republican vote  But when it comes to the CEO of a major bank who is already a multimillionaire we are talking about $6 million  $7 million  $8 million a year in tax breaks that is not what we should be doing as a nation  
Furthermore  I know President Obama and others have said  Well  let's not worry  because these tax breaks are just temporary just temporary  They are only going to be given for 2 years  I have been in Washington long enough to know that when you give a temporary tax break for 2 years  you are  in fact  giving a long-term tax break or maybe even a permanent tax break  Because 2 years from now  the exact same arguments will be made  if you do away with those tax breaks for the rich  you are raising taxes  Do you want to raise taxes  a terrible thing to do  That same argument will be made  
But there is one difference  The difference is that when President Obama ran for President and since he has been President  he has time and time again come out against those tax breaks  He does not believe in them  I believe him  and I know that he doesn't  But if he is the Democratic candidate for President and he says  Reelect me to be President because in the future I am going to really get rid of these tax breaks  I am afraid his credibility is not very high because that is what he said last time  I guess there is a limit as to how many times you can cry wolf  
(Mr  LEVIN assumed the Chair ) 
Mr  SANDERS  If these tax breaks for the wealthiest people are extended for 2 years  there is a strong likelihood they will be extended for many years beyond those 2 and perhaps even permanently  That brings us back to the Bush-era nonsense of believing that tax breaks for the rich and trickle-down economics are going to help the middle-class and working families of this country  
While the personal income tax issue and extending them for the top 2 percent has received a lot of national attention  what has not gotten a whole lot of discussion is that that is not the only unfair and absurd tax proposal out there  The agreement struck between the President and the Republican leadership continues the Bush era 15 percent tax rate on capital gains and dividends  meaning those people who make their living off of their investments will continue to pay a substantially lower tax rate than firemen  teachers  and nurses  So if you are a wealthy person and you earn money from dividends I believe the overwhelming majority of those capital gains accrue to the top 1 percent you are going to be paying a tax on that income of 15 percent  which is less than you pay if you are a fireman  a police officer  a teacher  or a nurse  So what we are doing there is extending not only the personal income tax breaks for the very rich but a host of other taxes as well  
On top of all of that and I know many of my colleagues have picked up on this and are extremely upset  and I think that is one of the reasons the Democrats in the House just yesterday said they don't want to bring this proposal to the floor for a vote this agreement includes a horrendous proposal regarding the estate tax  
The estate tax is a proposal Teddy Roosevelt talked about in the year 1906  It was eventually enacted in 1916  Here is what Teddy Roosevelt said about this issue in August of 1906 and it is worth repeating this because what the proposal struck between the President and the Republican leadership does is lower the estate tax substantially  Here is what Teddy Roosevelt said in 1906  
The absence of effective State  and  especially  national  restraint upon unfair money-getting has tended to create a small class of enormously wealthy and economically powerful men  whose chief object is to hold and increase their power  ..... 
This is Teddy Roosevelt  who by then had served as President of the United States  
He continued  
No man should receive a dollar unless that dollar has been fairly earned  Every dollar received should represent a dollar's worth of service rendered not gambling in stocks  but service rendered  
This guy was pretty prophetic back in 1910  
He continues  
The really big fortune  the swollen fortune  by the mere fact of its size acquires qualities which differentiated in kind as well as in degree from what is passed by men of relatively small means  Therefore  I believe in a graduated inheritance tax on big fortunes properly safeguarded against evasion and increasing rapidly in amount with the size of the estate  
Wow  Teddy Roosevelt hit the nail on the head  That was 100 years ago  He was worried that a small group of people with incredible money would be able to pass that money on  and what you would create would be an oligarchic form of government with a small number of people not just holding economic power but significant political power  
It is ironic that  right now  as a result of the disastrous Citizens United decision  what Roosevelt foretold  predicted  is exactly what is happening  You have a handful of billionaires now sitting around deciding how much of their fortune they are going to invest in political campaigns all over this country to defeat people like me who are opposed to their agenda and support other people who are in agreement with it  That is what Roosevelt talked about  That is exactly what is happening  
So what we are looking at in this proposal is a situation where the estate tax rate  which was 55 percent under President Clinton  will decline to 35 percent  with an exemption on the first $5 million of an individual's estate  $10 million per couple  Here is the important point that has to be made  I think a lot of people don't understand this  Certainly  our Republican friends have done a very good job in distorting reality on this one  There are millions of Americans who believe that when they die  their children will have to pay an estate tax  That is absolutely and categorically incorrect  As this chart shows  only a tiny fraction of estates from deaths in 2009 owed any estate tax  That number is about .24 percent  Less than three-tenths of 1 percent of American families paid any tax on the estates they were left  So 99 7 percent of American families did not pay one cent in estate taxes  That is the simple truth  The so-called death tax our Republican friends talk about a whole lot is the estate tax  and 99 7 percent of families don't pay a nickel on it  The people who do pay are not the rich; they are the very  very rich  
Let me give you one example of the absurdity of lowering the tax rate or  even worse  ending the estate tax  as some of our Republican colleagues would like to do  Here is this chart  One example of what well  this agreement doesn't do that; it lowers the rates  If they were to wipe it out completely  as Republicans want to do  Walmart owners  Sam Walton's family  the heirs to the Walmart fortune  which is worth well  it may be more or less now  but it is about $86 billion  One family is worth $86 billion  They are doing pretty good  If we abolish the estate tax  as our Republican friends would have us do  the Walton family alone would receive an estimated $32 7 billion tax break  if the estate tax was completely repealed one family  $32 7 billion  This is patently insane  This is insane  Insane  
We have the highest rate of childhood poverty in the industrialized world  We have massive unemployment  I am trying to get seniors 50-plus million people a $250 check  by the way  because we have not seen a COLA for the last 2 years for seniors and disabled vets  That would cost  in 1 year  about $14 billion  The Walton family itself would get more than double in a tax break what some of us are fighting for for over 50 million seniors and disabled vets  We can't afford to give $14 billion to help some of the people in this country who are struggling the hardest  We cannot do that  but somehow we can afford to give $32 7 billion in tax breaks to one of the richest families in this country  If that makes sense to anybody  please call my office  It doesn't make sense to me  and I don't think it makes sense to the vast majority of the American people  
Under this agreement  the estate tax rate  which was 55 percent under President Clinton  will decline to 35 percent  with an exemption on the first $5 million of an individual's estate  $10 million for couples  Let's remember again that this tax applies only to the top three-tenths of 1 percent of the families in this country  This is not just a tax break for the rich; it is a tax break for the very  very rich  
Again  this agreement says we are only going to extend this for 2 years  Well  frankly  I doubt that very much  I suspect that 2 years from now the same argument will be made  They will be extending it  Frankly  our Republican colleagues  representing the richest people in the world  are hell-bent on abolishing the estate tax completely  
Those are some of the reasons I think we should be voting against this agreement  
Third and this is an issue I have been talking about  and I am happy to hear there is more discussion about this in the last few days is the so-called payroll tax holiday  What that is about is that this would cut $120 billion in Social Security payroll tax for workers  On the surface  this sounds like a very good idea because the worker  instead of paying 6 2 percent into Social Security  pays 4 2 percent  If you think about it for 2 seconds  you really understand that it is not a good idea because this is money being diverted from the Social Security trust fund  
Social Security  in my view  has been the most successful Federal program in perhaps the history of our country  In the last 75 years  whether in good or bad times  Social Security has paid out every nickel owed to every eligible American  Today  Social Security has a $2 6 trillion surplus  Today  Social Security can pay out benefits for the next 29 years  Our goal  and what we must do  is make sure we extend it beyond 29 years  for the next 75 years  Well  if we divert $120 billion from the Social Security trust fund and give it to workers today  what you are doing is cutting back the viability the long-term viability of Social Security  
That is not just Bernie Sanders raising this issue  There are many people representing millions of senior citizens who are deeply concerned about this proposal this provision in the agreement between the President and the Republican leadership  
The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare is one of the very largest senior groups in America  They do a very good job  We have many seniors in Vermont who are members of this organization  Their job is to do what the title of the organization suggests  which is to preserve Social Security and Medicare  Just the other day  they sent out a news release  and the title of the news release was ``Cutting Contributions to Social Security Signals the Beginning of the End; Payroll Tax Holiday is Anything But '' 
Let me quote from Barbara Kennelly  a former member of Congress  who is the president and CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare  
Even though Social Security contributed nothing to the current economic crisis  it has been bartered in a deal that provides deficit-busting tax cuts for the wealthy  Diverting $120 billion in Social Security contributions for a so-called tax holiday may sound like a good deal for workers now  but it is bad business for the program that a majority of middle-class seniors will rely upon in the future  
That  again  is a quote from Barbara Kennelly  President and CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare  
Mr  President  I think many of us should understand where this concept originated  This is not a progressive idea  This is an idea that came from Republicans and conservatives who want to end Social Security  I want to read an interesting quote from a gentleman named Bruce Bartlett  Mr  Bartlett was a former top adviser to Presidents Reagan and George H W  Bush  This is what he wrote in opposition to this payroll tax cut  
What are the odds that Republicans will ever allow this 1-year tax holiday to expire  They wrote the Bush tax cuts with explicit expiration dates  Then  when it came time for the law they wrote to take effect  exactly as they wrote it  they said any failure to extend them permanently would constitute the biggest tax increase in history  
So what Mr  Bartlett is saying and I will go back to his quote in a second is what we all know to be true; that around here  in Congress  if you provide a tax break for 1 year in this case a payroll tax holiday a year from now  if you restore the old rates which are 6 2 percent our Republican friends are going to say Democrats are raising your taxes  It ``ain't'' gonna happen  
This 1-year extension could well become a permanent extension  and if it becomes a permanent extension  you are diverting a huge amount of money from Social Security and you are weakening the entire financial structure of Social Security in this country  which I expect is exactly what some would like to do  
President Obama says  Well  not to worry  It is only 1 year  Don't worry  that 1 year is going to be covered by the Federal Government  
So for the very first time  out of the Treasury Department  money is going to come into Social Security  which has always been 100 percent dependent  as it should be  on payroll taxes  For the first time  we are breaking that  Around here you do it once and it is going to continue  
Barbara Kennelly  the President of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare  says  
Cutting these contributions to Social Security signals the beginning of the end  
So we should be very  very  very mindful of that  We should not support this payroll tax  It is one of the more dangerous provisions in this agreement  
But let me get back now  if I might  to what Bruce Bartlett a former top adviser for Presidents Reagan and George H W  Bush recently wrote  
If allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire is the biggest tax increase in history one that Republicans claim would decimate a still fragile economy then surely the expiration of a payroll tax holiday would also constitute a massive tax increase on the working people of America  Republicans would prefer to destroy Social Security's finances or permanently fund it with general revenues than allow a once-suspended payroll tax to be reimposed  Arch Social Security hater Peter Ferrara once told me that funding it with general revenues was part of his plan to destroy it by converting Social Security into a welfare program rather than an earned benefit  
Once again  that is a quote from Bruce Bartlett  a former adviser to President Reagan and the first President Bush  So what he is saying is and this is maybe one of the sleeping issues in this agreement between the President and the Republican leadership we may be taking a huge step forward in destroying the most important program in this country which is Social Security by diverting now $120 billion  and in the future hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars from this program so that  in fact  it will not be there for our kids and our grandchildren  
Mr  President  the fourth point I want to make in opposition to this agreement and one that I have made before and read a little bit about is that while some of the business taxes in this agreement may work to create jobs  some of them won't  The more important point is that economists on both ends of the political spectrum believe the better way to spur the economy and to create the millions and millions of jobs we must create is to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure  
Just a few minutes ago I read excerpts from a very good book by a friend of mine  Arianna Huffington  entitled ``Third World America '' The purpose of her book was to give us a warning that if we as a nation do not get our act together in a variety of ways  including our physical infrastructure  we are headed down the pike to be a Third World nation  
According to the American Society of Civil Engineers  we as a nation need to spend $2 2 trillion in the next 5 years alone in order to take care of our infrastructure needs  
Unfortunately  this agreement  signed by the President and the Republicans  doesn't put one penny into infrastructure  So if we are serious about creating jobs  if we are serious about making sure our economy can be competitive in the global economy  we have to be watching what other countries are doing  and they are investing far more than we are  
The stimulus package  by the way  will help us very much in Vermont in this area  Right now  if you were to drive around the State of Vermont and I think in many other places in this country and you took out your cell phone  you would find it very hard to make calls in a number of areas of the State  A few months ago  I was literally a mile and a half away from our State capital in Montpelier  near Northfield  VT  I could not make a telephone call with my cell phone  That is true in many parts of Vermont and in many areas of America  We are lagging behind many other countries in terms of the accessibility of cell phone service and broadband and broadband  
So I am happy to say that in Vermont we received a very generous grant through the stimulus package that will help us  and other States did the same  But those are areas where we have to invest  You have to invest in broadband and make sure cell phone service is available in rural America all over America  I talked a moment ago about our train services  There are train services today which are worse than they were 30 or 40 years ago  It takes longer to get from destination A to destination B  China is investing huge sums of money building high-speed rail at a rate that we could not even dream about  
So while in this agreement we do have money for business tax cuts  I do not think that is the best way to invest taxpayer money if we are serious about creating the jobs that we need  Corporate America already is sitting on close to $2 trillion cash on hand  I don't know that more tax breaks are going to help them very much  I think that it is a lot smarter and I think most economists agree with me to be investing in our infrastructure  both to create jobs now and to improve our competitiveness in years to come  
Further  Mr  President  I want to say a word on this I mentioned this earlier today  President Obama talks about this being a compromise agreement; you can't get everything you want  I certainly understand that  But one of the aspects of the compromise he points to is an extension of unemployment benefits for 13 months  Well  let me be very clear  I think at a time when 2 million of our fellow Americans are about to lose their unemployment  at a time when unemployment is extraordinarily high long-term unemployment is  I think  higher than at any point on record  with people looking for work month after month after month and not finding it it would be morally unacceptable if this country did not extend unemployment benefits for those workers for 13 months  Yet the President sees this as a great sign of compromise  
I would argue the contrary  I would suggest to you that for the past 40 years  under both Democratic and Republican administrations and under Democratic and Republican leadership in the Senate or in the House  whenever the unemployment rate has been above 7 2 percent  
unemployment insurance has always been extended  In other words  this has been a bipartisan policy for 40 years  I don't want to see us seeing and accepting as a really great give on the part of Republicans something that they are giving us as part of a compromise when it has been bipartisan policy for 40 years under Democratic and Republican leadership  So I don't accept this as a great gift  I think the American people understand you don't turn your backs on unemployed workers people who have been unemployed for long periods of time  You don't allow those people to lose their homes  You don't force these people out into the streets  You don't take away what shreds of dignity they have remaining  That is not what you do  That has always been Republican philosophy as well as Democratic philosophy  This is not a great gift  So I do not accept this is a compromise  
Let me be very clear  As I said earlier  I do believe there are positive parts of this agreement that must be maintained as we move forward toward a better agreement  Let me cite some of them that make a lot of sense to me and that I believe we have to retain and build on  
The obvious one  in addition to extending unemployment benefits  is we have to extend middle-class tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans  As I have been documenting over and over again today  we are looking at a situation where the middle class in this country is collapsing  Under President Bush  the median family income went down by $2 200  People are losing their health care  It would be asinine  it would be unacceptable if the middle class did not continue to receive the tax breaks that were developed in 2001 and 2003  That  to a large degree  is what this fight is about  We have to extend those tax breaks to the middle class but not tax breaks to the millionaires and billionaires  
Further  there are some other good provisions in this agreement the earned-income tax credit for working Americans and the child and college tax credits and they are very important  They will keep millions of our fellow Americans from slipping out of the middle class and into poverty  and they will allow millions of our fellow citizens to send their kids to college  
I just talked a moment ago about the fact that we have over 100 000 families in this country where kids graduate high school wanting to go to college but can't afford to do so  This proposal will help them do that  and that is right  
But despite the fact there are some good and important provisions in this proposal  when we look at the overall package  when we look at a $13 7 trillion national debt and a declining middle class  I think what we have to say is this package just doesn't do it  It is just not good enough  
The President says he knows how to count votes  I understand that  He says  Well  you had a couple of votes here to make sure that we would not give tax breaks to millionaires  And the President has been very clear he does not want to do that  I understand that  But he says  What choice do I have  
I think the answer is that we have to fight this issue  In my view  the solution ultimately will not be resolved inside the beltway  in the Senate or in the House  It will be resolved when millions of Americans get on their telephones  get on their computers  and let their Senators and their Members of the House of Representatives know they are profoundly outraged that at a time when the rich never had it so good  and when we have a huge national debt  this agreement contains huge tax breaks for those people who don't need it  That is how we defeat this  
I am not sure that all alone here in the debate I am going to turn any of my Republican or even some Democratic colleagues around  
But I do believe that  if people all over this country stand up and say  Wait a minute  how much do the richest people in this country want  I just documented a few moments ago that the top 400 wealthiest people in this country saw a doubling of their income under President Bush a doubling of their income and tax rates went down  When is enough enough  How much do they need  
I think and I would hope  by the way  that this is certainly not just a progressive issue  I am a progressive  This is a conservative issue  Year after year  I have heard our conservative friends telling us  My goodness  we just cannot continue to raise the national debt; we have to do something about this unsustainable deficit  This agreement grows  increases the national debt  What kind of honest conservative can vote to increase the national debt  And if they do  please  no more lectures here on the floor of the Senate  Your hypocrisy will be known to everybody  Don't tell us you are concerned about the national debt and give tax breaks to billionaires and raise the national debt so our kids and grandchildren in the middle class will have to pay higher taxes in order to pay off the debt that was caused by you giving tax breaks to millionaires  Please  no more lectures on that issue  Just say  OK  rich people contributed to my campaign; I have to do what they want  That will be honest  Please  no more lectures about your concern about the national debt  
Again  I want to reiterate this point  Everybody says  Don't worry  these are only 2 years  These are not  in my view  2 years  If you do them for 2 years  the same old argument will be back 2 years from now  and we will be in the midst of a Presidential election  What our Republican friends will say  as sure as I am standing here and I am glad we have a gentleman putting this in the Congressional Record  I want people to go back to the Congressional Record  I am sure I will be proven right that 2 years from now our Republican friends will come back and they will say  Oh  my word  if you repeal these tax breaks  you are going to be raising taxes  We can't do that  
What will make the situation even more difficult 2 years from now than today is you have President Obama if he is the Democratic candidate 2 years from now  he will say  I don't believe in these tax breaks for the rich  and I will do my best to repeal them  But his credibility has been damaged because that is what he said in the last campaign  That is what he has been saying all along  The President does not believe in extending these tax breaks for the wealthy  I know that  Everybody knows that  But if he caves in now  who is going to believe he is not going to do the same thing 2 years from now  That is the damage  
Then I think what is even more troublesome is that once we move down the path of more tax breaks for the very wealthy  we are accepting the heart and soul of trickle-down economics  which has been  to my mind  a proven disaster  a failure  I remind the listeners and my colleagues that these tax breaks have been in existence since 2001  They were in existence throughout almost all of President Bush's tenure  The end result was that we lost 600 000 private sector jobs lost 600 000 private sector jobs  the worst job performance record maybe in the history of this country  Trickle-down economics does not work  
Giving tax breaks to billionaires does not stimulate the economy  Helping working families and the middle class get decent jobs and tax breaks for people who need the money and are going to spend the money is what creates jobs  not giving tax breaks to billionaires who do not need it and who are not going to spend it  
Again  the point I want to make here is that if people think  oh  this is just temporary  this is just 2 years  I believe they are kidding themselves  I believe that 2 years from now  the debate will be about extending them or perhaps even making them permanent  
At a time  as I mentioned earlier  where the top 1 percent has seen a huge increase in the percentage of income they earn in this country going from 8 percent in the 1970s to 23 5 percent now and where the top 1 percent now earns more income than the bottom 50 percent  it is totally absurd to be giving tax breaks to people who do not need them  and it is not good economics  as well  
Here is the other irony  as I also mentioned earlier I guess by this time  I am going to be doing a little repetition here  But as I mentioned earlier  you have a number of millionaires and some of the richest people in this country who will benefit from these tax breaks  Do you know what they are saying  Do you know what Warren Buffett is saying  Do you know what Bill Gates is saying  Do you know what Ben Cohen from Ben & Jerry's is saying  Do you know what many other wealthy people are saying  Hey  thanks very much; I don't need it  It is more important that you invest in our children  It is more important that we protect working families  We are doing just fine  thanks  Our incomes have soared  our tax rates have gone down  and we don't need it  In other words  we have this absurd situation that not only is this bad public policy  we are actually forcing tax breaks on people who don't need them and don't even want them  The richest people in this country Bill Gates  Warren Buffett we don't want it  
Here is something else  Here is something else that needs to be understood  What the Republicans are doing in this agreement is driving up the national debt  You may think that is not what the Republicans really believe in  They are supposed to be conservatives  They don't want a high national debt  Why would they be giving tax breaks to the rich and driving up the national debt  There is a rationale  These guys are not dumb  and I think they know what they are doing  Here is what the argument is  If you drive up the national debt and the deficit  you then come back to the floor of the Senate and you say  You know what  this national debt and deficit is unsustainable  The only way we can deal with it now is by cutting  cutting  cutting  We are already beginning to hear how some of those thoughts are going to develop  
There was  as you know  a deficit reduction commission appointed by the President  When I heard who was going to be chairing that commission and cochairing it Alan Simpson  a very nice gentleman but a very conservative gentleman who has attacked Social Security for a very long period of time  and Erskine Bowles  a conservative Democrat I had serious doubts about what was going to come out of that commission  The good news is  they needed 14 votes to pass their recommendations and they didn't get the 14  But a lot of the ideas that Senator Simpson and Mr  Bowles developed are going to be filtering around this institution  
What the Republicans will say is that when you have a huge debt which they helped create we are going to have to cut  What are we going to have to do  As you recall  that deficit reduction commission recommended a savage cut over 20 percent in Social Security benefits for young workers major cuts  There was talk about raising the Social Security age up to  I think  69  They are talking about cuts in Medicare  cuts in Medicaid  cuts in education  
Right now I think I have documented it a dozen times it is a horrendous situation when so many of our young people cannot afford to go to college  and the others who do go to college and graduate end up on average something like $25 000 in debt  These guys on the deficit reduction commission were recommending that the interest on that debt be accrued while students are in college  
Here we have us slipping behind the rest of the world in terms of our percentage of college graduates  and this recommendation is on young people  who do not have a lot of money  who were borrowing money  that they will have to pay more to go to college  You are going to see it  
Here is the argument good  it is going to be in the Congressional Record  Check it out  see if I am right  The argument will be  The deficit is going up  the national debt is going up  We have to attack and cut Social Security  Medicare  Medicaid  veterans programs  
This year Senator Landrieu from Louisiana made this point a little while ago and I think this is roughly right our soldiers  men and women in the Armed Forces  are going to get a 1 8-percent increase in their salaries this year  1 8 percent for people putting their lives on the line to defend this country  A $250 check for 50-plus million seniors and disabled vets we 
couldn't pass it; too much money $14 billion  They are going to come back and cut and cut in the name of trying to deal with the high deficit which they are now increasing  That is an issue we must be addressing  
In my view  while there are some good parts of the proposal  it is certainly one that should be significantly improved  I believe the way it can be improved is by the American people beginning to get involved in the process  
I can tell you  as I said earlier  I don't know how the calls are going today in my office because I have been here  but for the last 3 days  we have received thousands of phone calls and e-mails  and over 98 percent of them have been against this proposal  The American people believe  the people in Vermont believe we can do a lot better job in crafting a proposal that represents the middle class and our kids and not just the wealthiest people in this country  
When we talk about this proposal negotiated by the White House and Republican leadership  again  it has to be put within the broad context of what is going on in America  That context is not a pretty picture  That context requires us to understand that the middle class  which has been the backbone of this country for so very long  is in the process of disappearing  That context makes us understand that millions of families in this country are worried  parents are worried  not just about their own lives they are prepared to work 50 or 60 hours a week; they are prepared to cut back on their own needs  I think what is hurting them more deeply is the kind of future they are contemplating for their children  They are worried that  for the first time in the modern history of America  their kids will get jobs that will pay them lower salaries than what the parents have earned  They are worried that unemployment will be much more likely for their kids than for themselves  They are worried that while they were able to scrape through in my case  I was able to scrape through college  I borrowed some money  did some jobs  and made it like millions of other people  They are worried that with the high cost of a college education and the reduction in their real earnings  they are not going to be able to send their kids to college  I have received e-mails and I am sure you have  Mr  President the saddest thing in the world  where you have parents who are saying  We have saved all of our lives for the thing we wanted the most  which was to be able to send our son or daughter to college  and we can't do that now  That is the overall context this agreement has to be placed within  
The issue is  again and again  the richest people in this country do not need tax breaks  They are doing phenomenally well  They have already been given huge amounts of tax breaks  It is the middle class  it is the working families  it is the lower income people we have to be worrying about and not just the wealthy and the powerful  
When we talk about why the middle class is declining  that is a tough issue  I am not here to suggest I know all of the answers  I surely don't  It is a complicated issue  Honest people have differences of opinion  But let me touch on a few areas that I think will explain why poverty is going up and the middle class is going down  One of them deals with our trade policies  
I can remember a number of years ago I was in the House of Representatives  and I can remember the lobbyists and the big money interests coming around and saying  If you guys only pass NAFTA  this would create a whole lot of jobs in the United States because we would be able to ship products made in America to Mexico  In fact  as I recall it seems almost humorous now what they said is  If we pass NAFTA  it would solve the problem of illegal immigration because the economy of Mexico would be so strong that people would stay in their own country and not try to sneak across the border  That is  as we look back on it  somewhat humorous  that that issue was even discussed  
But one of the areas that  unfortunately  for a variety of reasons  we have not dealt with is our disastrous trade policy  That is NAFTA; that is permanent normal trade relations; that is trade policies which have encouraged large corporations in this country to send jobs abroad because they can find workers in other countries  in low-wage countries  who are prepared to work for pennies an hour  
I think not only have we not addressed this issue from an economic perspective the way we should  I have to tell you  I know that during campaigns  a lot of Members of Congress put their 30-second ads on the air saying how concerned they are about outsourcing and our trade policy  But somehow  the day after the election  I didn't hear that discussion resume on the floor of the House or the Senate  I want to say this is true not just of Republicans but of Democrats as well  
A lot of Democrats campaign on the need for trade reform  but it does not happen  In fact  I have been here in the Senate now for almost 4 years  I have not heard one serious underline ``serious''--discussion to explain how in recent years we have lost millions and millions of manufacturing jobs  when those jobs were the backbone of the working class of this country  not providing only decent wages but decent benefits  decent health care  decent pensions  
There was once a time in this country when a manufacturing job was a ticket to the middle class  I have to say something because I remember not so many years ago  there were national leaders saying  Well to the young people you do not have to worry about that factory work anymore  You do not have to be involved in production because  you know what  All of the jobs in the future are going to be nice and clean in offices and on computers  
I think we demeaned and insulted the people who built the products we consumed  There is nothing wrong with a factory job if workers there earn a decent wage and have a decent benefit  Those are the jobs that built America  I remember  and we should never forget and we now have celebrated the anniversary of Pearl Harbor  There was a speech that President Roosevelt gave a day after Pearl Harbor  in a joint session to the Congress  when he declared war on Japan  
I saw a video of that speech  It was a remarkable speech because  at that moment  at that moment  the United States was not only fighting Japan  and we knew the fight with Germany and Nazism was right around the corner  at that point we were having to fight a war on two fronts  in Asia and in Europe  Hitler was on the march; the Japanese were in China  The Japanese had just attacked Pearl Harbor  Here we were  just about to enter the war  How could we possibly win that war  
Yet because of the manufacturing capabilities that we had at that time  and this is an amazing story  literally in 2 1/2 years the war was essentially won  obviously not completed until 1945  But because of the incredible industrial capabilities in this country  the ability to transform our manufacturing sector from a consumer-oriented sector  from automobiles into tanks; from shirts into uniforms; from hunting rifles into machine guns  within 2 or 3 years we had essentially won that war  It was an incredible effort on the part of workers in this country who transformed our economy into an industrial force that was able to supply our soldiers with the weapons that they needed to defeat Hitler and the Japanese  
Where are we today in terms of our manufacturing capabilities  As I mentioned earlier  a couple of weeks ago  my wife and I went shopping for Christmas presents  literally  in just a plain old department store  It is literally very hard to find a product not manufactured in China  It is very hard to find a product  a gift that we could buy that was manufactured in the United States of America  
I think people understand instinctively that this country will not be a major economic player in years to come if we allow our manufacturing base to continue to decline  Again  just under Bush  we went from 17 million manufacturing jobs down to 12 million jobs  in 8 years of Bush  How do we survive as a strong industrial power if our manufacturing jobs disappear  
Today there are fewer manufacturing jobs in this country than there were in April of 1941  about 8 months before the attack on Pearl Harbor; fewer manufacturing jobs today than in April of 1941  Those manufacturing jobs that are left that are left in many cases pay lower wages  with fewer benefits  than they did a generation ago  
In other words  we are moving not only in a decline in our manufacturing jobs but in the wages our workers earn and the benefits they receive  
I raise all of these issues to put this agreement between the President and the Republican leadership in a broader context  Today and this is just an incredible fact  and it is absolutely frightening to the future of the middle class in this country today  entry level automobile workers at General Motors and Chrysler now earn half as much  half as much as their peers made just 1 year ago  Instead of making $28 an hour  a middle-class wage  they are now making $14 an hour  This is in the automobile industry which has always been the gold standard for manufacturing jobs in America  If workers with a union in the automobile industry are making $14 an hour  what do you think workers in New Mexico are going to be making without a strong union  
So what you are seeing is a dissolution of the middle class  wages are going down  and in this remarkable example  a 50-percent reduction; the older workers making good wages  new workers half the wages  
Is this the future of America  Is this what our kids have to look forward to  that they are going to be earning half the wages their fathers made  that their mothers made  Is that the future  In the midst of all of that  we run up a huge national debt  send our jobs to China  and we give tax breaks to millionaires  Is that the future these kids have to look forward to  I certainly hope not  We are going to have to be tough  and we are going to have to take on some very powerful special interests to turn this whole thing around  
Today I have devoted a lot of time to our national debt  $13 7 trillion  and to our deficit  which is $1 4 trillion  But we cannot ignore our trade deficit  In 2008  our trade deficit was nearly $700 billion  Last year our trade deficit with China alone was almost $227 billion  In other words  we are purchasing a whole lot more products than we are selling  
Sometimes I get a kick out of hearing the defenders of our trade policy talk about all of the products we are exporting  Well  yeah  we are exporting a lot  but we are importing a heck of a lot more  So I think what you have is a major economic issue  That economic issue is that we are losing millions of good-paying jobs because of our disastrous trade policy  Furthermore  the jobs we have  on those jobs  we are seeing a decline in wages and in benefits  
I think the bottom line of this is not just an economic issue  it is a moral issue as well  and that is when companies such as General Electric and all the rest I do not mean to be picking a lot on General Electric  but I have a quote I want to make  This was a few years back  I think it is important because it applies not just to General Electric  But I want people to hear this  GE is  of course  one of our major corporations  The manufacturer's recent disclosure pointed out  the taxpayers of this country  through the Fed  provided $16 billion in bailout to General Electric during the recent crisis  This is what the head  the CEO of General Electric  Jeffrey Immelt  said in 2002  December 6  
When I am talking to GE managers  I talk China  China  China  China  China  You need to be there  You need to change the way people talk about it and how they get there  I am a nut on China  Outsourcing from China is going to grow to 5 billion  We are building a tech center in China  Every discussion today has to center on China  The cost basis is extremely attractive  You can take an 18-cubic-foot refrigerator  make it in China  land it in the United States  and land it for less than we can make an 18-cubic-foot refrigerator today ourselves  
Gee  A couple of years ago when GE had some difficult economic times  and they needed $16 billion to bail them out  I did not hear Mr  Immelt going to China  China  China  China  China  I did not hear that  I heard Mr  Immelt going to the taxpayers of the United States for his welfare check  
So I say to Mr  Immelt  and I say to all of those CEOs who have been so quick to run to China  that maybe it is time to start reinvesting in the United States of America  But it is not just Mr  Immelt  I do not mean to just pick on him  It is all of them  They all see the future in China  in Vietnam  in countries where people work for pennies an hour  
Mr  Immelt came to his decision in the footsteps of the former CEO of GE  Jack Welsh  What Jack Welsh was famously quoted as saying  
Ideally  
This is the guy who was head of General Electric before Immelt  He said  
Ideally  we would have every plant we own on a barge  
Do you remember that quote  He said  
Ideally  we would have every plant we own on a barge  
What did he mean by that  What he meant by that  if you are on a barge  you can move your plant to any part of the world where the labor is cheapest  So if it gets too expensive in China  and you have to pay people 75 cents an hour  you go to Vietnam  If it gets too expensive in Vietnam  maybe you can go to North Korea and have people work under marshal law  I do not know  
But what he was saying is  his goal was to make sure that GE would create jobs in those countries in the world where workers were paid the lowest possible wage  
Former GE executive vice president Frank Doyle said  
We did a lot of violence to the expectations of the American workforce  We downsized  we delayered  and we outsourced  
He was honest enough to admit that  But  again  I do not mean to just pick on Jeff Immelt or General Electric  It is a history of corporations all over America  
Let me just mention that the CEO of Cisco  John Chambers and this is what he says  You know  we tell the young people  The future is in information technology  We want you guys to be smart  Learn how to use the computers  You are not going to work in factories  
This is what the CEO of Cisco  certainly one of the large IT companies in the United States  said  
China will become the IT center of the world  And we can have a healthy discussion about whether that's in 2020 or 2040  What we are trying to do is outline an entire strategy of becoming a Chinese company  
This was in 2004  
Furthermore  
He says  October 15  2004 this is Cisco  
we believe in giving something back and truly becoming a Chinese company  
Meanwhile  when Cisco needs tax breaks  they get it from the taxpayers of the United States of America  Boy  are they taking us for dummies  They outsource their jobs to China and so forth  
In the last campaign  one of the folks who ended up getting a lot more publicity than he usually does is the president and CEO of the U S  Chamber of Commerce  a gentleman named Tom Donohue  
(Mr  UDALL of New Mexico assumed the chair ) 
Mr  SANDERS  Again  my point is not to just pick on individuals  Every quote I am giving can be multiplied 50  100 times over  This is what corporate America believes  They believe it is totally appropriate to throw American workers out on the street  move to low- wage countries  China and other countries  pay people a few cents an hour  and bring their products back into the United States  
Mr  Tom Donohue is the president and CEO of the U S  Chamber of Commerce  He got a lot of publicity during the last election because the Chamber of Commerce became the funnel for a lot of money that went into campaigns around the country  They raised tens of millions of dollars  a lot of the money  that was undisclosed  All the rich folks and billionaires gave money to the Chamber of Commerce  and they were able to elect candidates who were sympathetic to their point of view  
Let's find out what their point of view is  This is a quote going back to 2004  
One job sent overseas  if it happens to be my job  is one too many  But the benefit of offshoring jobs outweighs the cost  
That was Tom Donohue  president and CEO of the largest business organization in America  They are in favor of offshoring American jobs  They think it is a good idea  They understand that if corporations throw American workers out on the street and go to China and pay people there pennies an hour  it will make more profits  Give them credit  They are upfront about it  We don't care about the United States of America  We don't care about young people  We don't care about the future of this country  The future of the world is in China  
Here is a quote that appeared in one of the papers  
U S  Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Thomas Donohue urged American companies to send jobs overseas  
That was in 2004  This is an AP story  
U S  Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Thomas Donohue  
This is the head of the largest business organization in America  That is where all these businesses come together to develop policy  to lobby us  to provide campaign contributions  
urged American companies to send jobs overseas 
That is really patriotic  That is standing up for the United States  
Donohue said Wednesday that exporting high-paid tech jobs to low-cost countries such as India  China  and Russia saves companies money  It's no surprise that Donohue  who tripled the Chamber of Commerce's lobbying team since 1997 and aggressively promotes pro-business policies  endorses offshoring  The 3 million member organization  the Chamber of Commerce  the world's largest business consortium  champions tax cuts  free trade  workers compensation reform  and more liberal trade policies with China  
What more do we need to understand why we have lost millions of good-paying manufacturing jobs  why wages are going down  What more do we need when the president of the Chamber of Commerce tells us he thinks it is good public policy to send jobs to China  I don't think there is much we have to discover  They are telling us this  
In a moment what I will be talking about is how these ideas from the big-moneyed people become implemented in policy which has to do a lot with lobbying and campaign contributions  Before I go there  I wish to give some more examples about how business leaders feel about the workers of this country and the young people  
This  again  is a quote  I apologize  It is a few years old  from 2004  January 19  This is from Alan Lacy  the CEO of Sears Roebuck and Company at the time  
There are four or five times as many smart  driven people in China than there are in the United States  And there are another four or five  three or four times as many people in India that are smarter or as smart or have more drive  And if technology is now going to basically reduce location as a barrier to competition  
I e , you have a World Wide Web and you can do your work in China or India  
then essentially you have something like  whatever that was  seven or nine times more smart  committed people than are now competing in this marketplace against certain activities  
So we are going to see  I think  a huge incentive to ship some of these more commoditylike knowledge workers' jobs offshore  
So here we have our blue-collar jobs decimated  and we told the kids not to worry  You didn't want to work in the factory anyhow  We have good information technology  computer-based jobs for you  But then you have the heads of large corporations saying  Why do I want American young people to do this  I can have Indian young people do it who will work for a fraction of the wages  We all see this  It is nothing new  You try to get a plane reservation and you are talking to somebody in India  Please  do not hear me as being anti-Indian or anti-Chinese  That is the furthest thing I would want anyone to think  We want to work with people all over the world  But we don't have to destroy the middle class of this country to help people around the world  You don't have to be a corporate CEO to sell out your own people who built your company to run abroad  This Senator is not anti-Chinese  far from it  anti-Indian  anti-Vietnamese  I guess I plead guilty to being pro-American  Maybe that is suspect here  
The former CEO of Hewlett-Packard  Carly Fiorina  ran for Senator  This is what she said when she was the CEO of Hewlett-Packard in 2004  
There is no job that is America's God-given right anymore  
I could go on and on and on  but I think we have the point  The point is that when things get rough for corporate America  as they did recently for General Electric  they run to the taxpayers in order to be bailed out  But their overall philosophy is that their goal in life is to make as much money as they can in any way they can  and  therefore  you run to those countries where wages are low  
We are seeing it all the time  It is not just blue collar; it is increasingly white color  We have radiologists who are reading X-rays in India  People behind the computer can do work in India as well as here  and these corporate folks have taken advantage of that and sold out the young people of this country and the working class  
It is virtually impossible to find anything in a Walmart or other stores such as that that is made in America today  This is essentially true for clothing  An increasing amount of clothing comes from Bangladesh  Today  there are 4 000 garment factories in Bangladesh making clothing for Walmart  Gap  JC Penney  Levi Strauss  Tommy Hilfiger  and many others  Garment workers in Bangladesh  some 3 5 million of them and the number is growing are among the lowest paid workers in the world  They have difficulty buying enough food and shelter for their own needs  
The good news is the minimum wage in Bangladesh was doubled  It went from 11 5 cents an hour to 23 cents an hour  So when you buy your shirt made in Bangladesh  you have young women there coming in from the countryside who are now paid  because of a doubling of the minimum wage  23 cents an hour  Is that something our people should be asked to compete against  Should we say to the American worker  We can get you jobs  We are prepared to invest in the United States  We are an American company  You helped make us great  Thank you for the work you have done over the years  Thank you for purchasing our products  Thank you for making go us strong  If you are prepared to work for $1 an hour  $2 an hour  $3 an hour  we will come back  
By the way  in the last campaign  what did we hear rumblings of  Abolishing the minimum wage  The minimum wage is now $7 25 an hour  There are people out there who say  Look  if I can hire somebody in China for $2 or $3 an hour and you want a job in America and I have to pay you $7 25 an hour  why would I want to do that  If we abolish the minimum wage  I may hire you  
What a wonderful prospect for our young people to think about  working for $4 or $5 an hour  
If we want to understand why the middle class is collapsing  why unemployment is high  why our manufacturing base has been decimated  why it is hard to purchase a product made in the United States  it has a lot to do with our trade policies  which were pushed by people such as Mr  Donohue of the Chamber of Commerce and many others  
But it is not just a disastrous trade policy that has brought us to where we are today  The immediate cause of this crisis is and this gets me sick thinking about it what the crooks on Wall Street have done to the American people  These people fought for a period of years to deregulate the banking industry  These people said to us  Well  if you just would do away with Glass-Steagall  if you will just allow financial institutions  commercial banks  investor banks  insurance companies  if you allow them to merge  do away with these walls which Glass-Steagall  since the Great Depression  established  my God  it will be just terrific  It will be good for the economy  good for the American people  good for our international competitiveness  
I remember those debates because I was at that point in the House of Representatives  I was a member of the Financial Institutions Committee at that point  I was on the committee that dealt with that  I remember all the times Alan Greenspan came before the committee and Robert Rubin  We had Republicans  Democrats coming before the committee and saying  This is what you have to do  You have to deregulate  You have to let these guys merge  Bigger is better  Against my votes  Somewhere on the Internet there is a discussion I had with Alan Greenspan when he came before our committee  I made it very clear to the people of Vermont  to him and everybody else  that I did not think deregulation was a good idea  that I thought it would lead to disaster  Someplace in this world there is a quote of mine which pretty much predicts what was going to happen  But needless to say  I was one vote  The majority of the Members in the House and Senate voted to deregulate  The rest is  unfortunately  history  
What we saw is people on Wall Street operating from a business model based on fraud  based on dishonesty  understanding that the likelihood of them ever getting caught was small  that if things got very bad  they would be bailed out by the taxpayers  understanding that they are too powerful to ever be put in jail  to be indicted  understanding that in this country when you are a CEO on Wall Street  you have so much wealth and so much power and so many lawyers and so many friends in Congress  you could do pretty much anything you want and not much is going to happen to you and they did it  Their greed and recklessness and their illegal behavior destroyed this economy  
What they did to the American people is so horrible  Here we had a middle class which was already being battered as a result of trade agreements  loss of manufacturing jobs  health care costs going up  couldn't afford to send their children to college that had gone on for years and then these guys started pushing worthless and complicated financial instruments and the whole thing explodes  
And they come crying to the taxpayers of America to bail them out  
I will never forget never forget Hank Paulson coming before the Democratic caucus I am an Independent and have long been serving as an Independent in Congress saying that within a few days he needed $700 billion or the entire world's financial system would collapse  My suggestion to him at that meeting was  If you need the money  why don't you go to your friends and get the money  Why don't you go to all your banker friends and millionaire friends and billionaires friends and get some of that money  and don't go to the middle class of this country that has already been harmed  
In fact  we brought an amendment to the floor of the Senate  which was one of the first amendments I brought as a Senator  which said that the top 2 percent should pay for the bailout  not the American people  It got defeated on a voice vote  
So what happens on Wall Street is we have seen a tremendous concentration of ownership there  another issue we do not talk enough about  I know Senator Brown and Senator Kaufman and I worked on a proposal to try to break up these large financial institutions  I think we got 30-some-odd votes on that  We could not do it  
So what the American people should know now is  while we bailed out Wall Street  because they were too big to fail  three out of the four largest financial institutions all of whom were bailed out very significantly are now larger today than they were before the bailout  
Incredibly  since the start of the financial crisis  Wells Fargo has grown 43 percent bigger  JPMorgan Chase has grown 51 percent bigger  and Bank of America is now 138 percent larger than before the financial crisis began  
Can you imagine that  We bailed these guys out because they were too big to fail  and now three out of the four largest ones are much larger than they were  How did that happen  Well  in 2008  Bank of America the largest commercial bank in this country which received a $45 billion taxpayer bailout  purchased Countrywide  the largest mortgage lender in this country  and Merrill Lynch  the largest stock brokerage firm in the country  That is how Bank of America expanded  They were too big to fail  Today they are much bigger  
In 2008  JPMorgan Chase  which received a $25 billion bailout from the Bush Treasury Department and a $29 billion bridge loan from the Federal Reserve  acquired Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual  the largest savings and loan in the country  That is how JPMorgan Chase  a huge bank  became even bigger  
In 2008  the Treasury Department provided an $18 billion tax break to Wells Fargo to purchase Wachovia  allowing that bank to control 11 percent of all bank deposits in this country  
Hear this because this is quite unbelievable  When we try to understand what is going on in the economy today the rich getting richer  the poor getting poorer  the middle class collapsing today  after we bailed out all these large banks  three out of four of them are now much larger than they were before  Today  Bank of America  JPMorgan Chase  Citigroup  and Wells Fargo the four largest financial institutions in this country hold about $7 4 trillion in assets  and that is equal to over half the Nation's estimated total output last year  Four financial institutions have assets worth more than 52 percent of our total output last year  
Instead of breaking up these folks  these large institutions  we let them get bigger  In fact  according to Simon Johnson  the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund  
As a result of the crisis and various government rescue efforts  the largest 6 banks in our economy now have total assets in excess [he claims] of 63 percent of GDP  ..... This is a significant increase from even 2006  when the same banks' assets were around 55 percent of GDP  ..... 
Do you understand what this is about  Four financial institutions owning over half the assets of America  You talk about economic power  you talk about political power  that is what we are talking about  
Simon Johnson continues  This is ``a complete transformation compared with the situation in the U S  just 15 years ago when the 6 largest banks had combined assets of only around 17 percent of GDP '' 
So 15 years ago  17 percent  six banks; today  four banks  and  he claims  63 percent of GDP  In other words  over the last 15 years  the largest banks in this country have more than tripled in size  
Not only are too-big-to-fail financial institutions bad for taxpayers  the enormous concentration of ownership in the financial sector has led to higher bank fees  usurious interest rates on credit cards  and fewer choices for consumers  What do you think happens when you have a few institutions  a handful of institutions  controlling mortgage lending or where people get their credit cards  
Today  these huge financial institutions have become so big that according to the Washington Post  The four largest banks in America now issue one out of every two mortgages  two out of three credit cards  and hold $4 out of every $10 in bank deposits in the entire country  
If any of these financial institutions were to get into major trouble again  taxpayers would be on the hook for another substantial bailout  We cannot allow that to happen  So the whole reason for the bailout was that if any of these financial institutions collapsed  it would take down a significant part of the economy and millions of jobs  We had to prop them up  We had to bail them out  It turns out that since we bailed them out  these handful of financial institutions are now even larger than they were before and we now know they are enjoying very strong profits and they are paying their CEOs even more in compensation than they did before the breakdown  
In my view  if we are serious about understanding why the middle class is collapsing  if we are serious about getting this economy moving again long term  we have to have the courage to do exactly what Teddy Roosevelt did back in the trust-busting days and break up these banks  The point Roosevelt was making was  it is bad for the economy when a handful of entities control industry after industry  They have a stranglehold on the economy  You have to break them up  Yet I have heard very little discussion I know there was an amendment from Sherrod Brown and Ted Kaufman  and I introduced legislation on this issue to start breaking them up  But  frankly  their lobbyists and their money are such that it becomes very difficult to do that  But that is exactly what we should be doing  
The legislation I introduced last year  S  2746  the Too Big to Fail  Too Big to Exist Act  would break up these large financial institutions  That legislation would require the Secretary of Treasury to identify every single financial institution and insurance company in this country that is too big to fail within 90 days; and after 1 year  the Secretary of the Treasury would be required to break up these institutions so their failure would not lead to the collapse of the U S  or global economies  
I think that is pretty obvious  We passed a financial reform bill  which I supported and got a major provision in there asking for disclosure at the Fed  an investigation of conflicts of interest at the Fed  and an audit of the Fed during the financial crisis  But overall  I  by no means  think that legislation went anywhere near far enough  I think that is a modest piece of legislation and an issue we have to revisit  
I worry very much about the future because I have a feeling in my stomach that day is going to come around again  when these huge financial institutions are tottering  when they are going to go running to Washington  and they are going to say  Hey  you have to bail us out  In my view  if an institution is too big to fail  it is too big to exist  Let us break them up so we do not have to go through another bailout of Wall Street  
Furthermore  I believe when you have that kind of concentration of ownership when you have four large financial institutions holding half the mortgages in this country  controlling two-thirds of the credit cards  and 
amassing 40 percent of all deposits this is not good for a competitive economy  
We are supposed to be living in free market capitalism  real competition  This is not free market competition  This is a huge concentration of ownership  where a few people have enormous power over the economy  and with their wealth  the political life of this country  
No single financial institution should be so large that its failure would cause catastrophic risk to millions of American jobs or to our Nation's economic well-being  No single financial institution should have holdings so extensive that its failure could send the world's economy into crisis  We were there 2 years ago  and in many ways  despite the passage of the financial reform bill  we are even more there now  The big  huge financial institutions we bailed out are bigger  more huge today  
Interestingly enough  on that issue  it is not just progressives such as myself who hold that view  There are some pretty conservative folks who are honest conservatives  The concentration of ownership in a handful of entities; is that a conservative proposition  Not in terms of my understanding of what conservatives are about  I do not think so  
You have at least three Federal Reserve Bank presidents who support breaking up too-big-to-fail banks  James Bullard  president and chief executive of the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis; Kansas City Fed president Thomas M  Hoenig; and Dallas Fed president Richard W  Fisher these guys do not have my political views  I am a proud progressive  My guess is they are conservatives  But anybody with an ounce of brains in their head understands that four large financial institutions that have assets that are more than half the GDP of the United States of America places us  A  in a very dangerous position in terms of too big to fail  and  B  it is just bad for a competitive economy  
Is there any wonder why people are paying 25 percent or 30 percent interest rates on their credit cards  That is because these guys issue two-thirds of the credit cards in America  Is there any reason why they were issuing fraudulent mortgage packages to people  Because there is not the kind of competition that should be there  
But this is not just Bernie Sanders' point of view  Here is what Kansas City Fed President Hoenig said  I am sorry I do not have a date on that  but I think it was fairly recently last year  This is Kansas City Fed President Hoenig  
I think they should be broken up  I think there's no reason why as we've done in other instances of [sic] finding the right mechanism to break them into their components  ..... 
And in doing so  I think you'll make the financial system itself more stable  I think you will make it more competitive  and I think you will have long-run benefits over our current system  [which] mixes it and therefore leads to bailouts when crises occur  
This is Thomas Hoenig  the head of the Kansas City Fed  A very simple statement  He is absolutely right  But and I am going to get to the reason why in a little while we have not been able to do this  We have not been able to do this because Wall Street sends their lobbyists down here in droves and Wall Street provides zillions of dollars in campaign contributions and Wall Street fights like the dickens to make sure that any strong provisions that some of us might bring up are defeated  Here is what the President of the Dallas Fed  Mr  Fisher  said  
[B]ased on my experience at the Fed ..... the marginal costs of too-big-to-fail financial institutions easily dwarf their purported social and macroeconomic benefits  
The risk posed by coddling too big to fail banks is simply too great  
Winston Churchill said that  He is quoting Mr  Churchill  
In finance  everything that is agreeable is unsound and everything that is sound is disagreeable  
That is from Churchill  
Mr  Fisher continues  
I think the disagreeable but sound thing to do regarding institutions that are too big to fail is to dismantle them over time into institutions that can be prudently managed and regulated across borders  This should be done before the next financial crisis because we now know it surely cannot be done in the middle of a crisis  
That is Dallas Fed president Mr  Fisher  
They are already in the process of breaking up big banks in England  According to the Washington Post  
The British government announced Tuesday  
Not this Tuesday  way back last year  
that it will break up parts of major financial institutions bailed out by taxpayers  The British government  spurred on by European regulators  is forcing the Royal Bank of Scotland  Lloyds Banking Group  and Northern Rock to sell off parts of their operations  Europeans are calling for more and smaller banks to increase competition and to eliminate banks so large that they must be rescued by taxpayers  no matter how they conducted their business  in order to avoid damaging the global financial system  
A very interesting development occurred on October 15 of last year  On October 15 as I mentioned earlier  Alan Greenspan  who was the chairman of the Fed before Mr  Bernanke  and I have had our run-ins  Mr  Greenspan  along with Mr  Rubin and others  were the chief proponents Larry Summers in there were the chief proponents of deregulation of financial institutions  and Mr  Greenspan and I had more than a few arguments  But on October 15 of last year  Alan Greenspan  who admitted his views on deregulation were wrong and I give the man courage for at least admitting he was wrong  He did a heck-of-a-lot of damage  but at least he had the courage to admit he was wrong  He was quoted in Bloomberg News as saying  
If they are too big to fail  they are too big  In 1911  we broke up Standard Oil  So what happened  The individual parts became more valuable than the whole  
Maybe that's what we need to do  
Alan Greenspan  the architect of deregulation  citing the fact that in 1911 we broke up Standard Oil  So here we have Greenspan  who helped cause this crisis  at least having the courage to understand that now is the time to begin breaking up these big financial institutions  They have enormous power over our economy  They have enormous power over our political life  Their lobbyists are all over this place  You can't walk down the hall without bumping into some of their lobbyists  So we have to start breaking them up and the American people have to be prepared for a major fight to take on these huge financial institutions  
Former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker  who has advised the Obama administration  supports breaking up big banks so they no longer pose systemic risk to the entire economy  
According to a recent article in the New York Times  Volcker said  
People say I'm old-fashioned and banks can no longer be separated from nonbank activity  That argument brought us to where we are today  
Paul Volcker  I couldn't agree more  That is what I am talking about  We have to start breaking up four financial institutions which led us into the economic disaster we are in right now that remain much too big to fail  that we are going to have to bail out again and again and again  and that today have a stranglehold on our economy  
The New York Times says under Volcker's plan  
JPMorganChase would have to give up their trading operations acquired from Bear Stearns  Bank of America and Merrill Lynch would go back to being separate companies  Goldman Sachs could no longer be a bank holding company  
That is exactly what needs to be happening  
I come from a small State  We have community banks  Here is the irony  The banks in Vermont  in the midst of all of this financial disaster  did just fine  They are small  locally owned banks  They know the people they lend money to  The CEOs are not making hundreds of millions of dollars in profit  They know their community  They know what loans made sense  Now  I may be old-fashioned like Mr  Volcker  but I think that is what banking is about  to lend out money to people in the productive economy  to the business community  who can use the money to expand and create jobs; to homeowners who need that money to buy a home  not to be living in your own world engaged in a huge gambling casino producing and selling worthless products nobody understands  
The function of a bank is to be a middleman between people who need money and are producing real products and helping them get that money and people who are investing in the banks  It is not supposed to be an island to itself  But in recent years what we have seen  incredibly  is that 40 percent of all profit in America went to the financial institutions with a small number of people working there  relatively small  They got 40 percent of the profits because they live in a world that is a huge gambling casino  
We need financial institutions to go back to the way banking used to be  where the job of banks was to provide affordable loans to the productive economy so we can produce real products  real goods  and we can create real jobs when we do that  
Robert Reich  President Clinton's former Labor Secretary  said  
No important public interest is served by allowing giant banks to grow too big to fail  Wall Street banks should be split up  and soon  
We have a lot of people  some conservatives  some progressives  who are saying the same thing  If we are going to rebuild the middle class  the way to do that is  among other things  to change our disastrous trade policies  to make it clear to corporate America that they cannot continue to sell out the workers of this country by moving to China and other low-wage countries  We also have to have a much more competitive economy  one in which all large financial institutions do not own assets of more than half of the GDP of this country  
On that point  I find it very interesting that it is not just progressives such as myself or Robert Reich  but we have some conservative bankers people who are heading Fed banks around this country who are saying pretty much the same thing  
Also  when we talk about banks  I wish to get back to a point I raised earlier  This is an issue I have been working on for years and years  and this is the issue of usury  I mentioned earlier  if you read the religious tenents of the major religions throughout history  whether it is Christianity  Judaism  Islam  and others  what you find is almost universal objection and disgust and a feeling of immorality in terms of usury  When we talked about usury in the United States  what we usually talked about were thugs  gangsters working on street corners who lent out money at outrageously high interest rates to workers  and when that money was not repaid back at the interest rates asked for  the thugs would beat up the workers  
In fact  I am thinking now about the first movie of Rocky  I don't know if the Presiding Officer saw the first movie of Rocky with Sylvester Stallone  but before he became a successful fighter and the heavyweight champion of the world  that is what he was  a big tough guy who beat up people who did not pay back the gangsters the high interest rates they were asking for  
Well  the world has changed  Now the people who are committing usury are not the gangsters on street corners all over America  Their place has been taken by the CEOs of Wall Street financial institutions who are lending out money to desperate Americans at 25 or 30 percent interest rates  That  my friends  is called usury  and according to every religion on Earth  that is immoral  What you are doing is going up to people who are desperate  people who are hurting  and you are saying  You desperately need money  we are going to give you money  but there is a string attached  You are going to be charged an outrageous amount of interest on that money  
So here is the irony  The people who are hurting the most pay the highest interest rates  The people who need the money the least are paying the lowest interest rates  
So the Fed lent out billions and billions of dollars to the largest financial institutions and offered it at less than 1 percent  That is American taxpayer money large corporations  less than 1 percent  
But if you are a worker today and you are having hard times maybe you are unemployed you are going to pay 25 or 30 percent interest rates on your credit card  and sometimes more  You have this Payday Lending where people are paying outrageous sums of money  I think that is immoral  I think we have to stop it  and it disturbs me very much that especially at a time when we bailed out these large financial institutions they are still able to charge our people 25 or 30 percent  People who have bailed them out get hit the second time around by having to pay 25 to 30 percent interest rates  
Right now  it is not even 25 or 30 percent  As a matter of fact  the tenth largest credit card issuer in this country  an entity called Premier Bank  is now offering a credit card with a 79 9-percent interest rate and a $300 credit limit  What do we make of that  The tenth largest credit card issuer in this country is charging 79 percent interest rates  and we allow that to go on  These are crooks  These are no different than the gangsters who beat up people on street corners when they didn't get payment back  except now the gangsters are wearing three-piece suits and sitting in some fancy suite on Wall Street  
Today  over one-quarter of all credit card holders in this country are now paying interest rates above 20 percent and  as I indicated  as high as 79 percent  Let's be clear  When credit card companies charge over 20 percent interest on credit cards  they are not engaged in the business of making credit available  What they are involved in is extortion and loan sharking nothing essentially different than gangsters  except they dress a lot better  That is all it is  It is thievery and we tolerate it  and we bail them out  
It is interesting in terms of these high interest rates because for many years we have had States  including the State of Vermont  saying  You are not going to charge outrageously high interest rates  For example  establishing a usury law is not a radical concept  which is what we have to move toward  We have to put a cap on interest rates  In fact  between 1978 and today  over 20 States in America had laws capping credit card interest rates  
In Alabama  the legal maximum amount of interest is 8 percent; in Alaska  it is 10 5 percent; in Arizona  it is 10 percent; in Idaho  12 percent; Kansas  15 percent; the State of Vermont  my own State  the legal maximum interest rate is 12 percent  But what happened is all of those State interest rate caps disappeared under the 1978 U S  Supreme Court decision known as the Marquette case  which allowed banks to charge whatever interest rates they wanted if they moved to a State without an interest rate law such as South Dakota or Delaware  
So all of these companies moved to South Dakota  They moved to Delaware  No interest rates  And they charged the people in Vermont or Hawaii or anyplace else 35 percent interest rates  
So getting back to the original agreement which I strongly disagree with that the President and the Republican leadership agreed to  I think that agreement significantly helps the upper income people by lowering the tax rates for millionaires and billionaires  by lowering the interest rate on the estate tax  and by providing some business loans which are not the kinds of investments that can best create jobs  
(The PRESIDENT pro tempore assumed the chair ) 
One of the things we have to do to protect the middle class today is have a cap on interest rates because otherwise people are getting a paycheck and then going into debt and paying 25  30 percent on their interest rates  with the money going to a handful of banks on Wall Street  
I have introduced legislation to put a cap on interest rates  and it is not a radical idea  Right now  credit unions in this country  by law  are not allowed to charge more than 15 percent  except under extraordinary circumstances  By and large  that has worked for about 30 years  So if you get a credit card through a credit union  you are going to be paying in almost every case no more than 15 percent  That was developed by Federal law  
Do you know what  I have talked to the credit union people in Vermont and all over the country  Credit unions are doing just fine  They are not the ones that came begging the American taxpayer for a huge bailout  So for 30 years they have survived just fine on a 15-percent cap  But our friends on Wall Street who caused this recession  our friends on Wall Street who needed a welfare check from the American people in order to survive  who today are earning more money than they did before the bailout we don't have any cap on the interest rates they can charge  
In my view  if the credit unions have survived and survived well with a 15-percent maximum interest rate cap the most they can charge and it worked for credit unions  it can work for the private banks as well  That is what we have to do  
According to a recent article this is a year ago in the Los Angeles Times  
Chris Collver  legislative and regulatory analyst for the California Credit Union League  said that a rate cap hasn't hurt business for nearly 400 credit unions represented by his organization  ``It hasn't been an issue '' he said  ``Credit unions are still able to thrive '' 
Here is my point  The middle class is hurting  Unemployment is outrageously high  poverty is increasing  there are 50 million people with no health insurance  there is a gap between the rich and everybody else  manufacturing is collapsing  and jobs are going all over the world China  Mexico  India  We have to start protecting the middle class of this country  
There are a number of things we have to do  I think one simple thing we have to do is tell the crooks on Wall Street and I use that word advisedly history will prove that they knew what they were doing  They were dishonest  The business model is fraudulent  There are honest people who occasionally make a mistake  but there are other businesses that are based on fraud and assume they are never going to get caught  When they do get caught  the penalty they have to pay is so little that it is worth it because they end up getting caught 1 out of 10 times  but they make a whole lot of money  and then they pay a fine and somebody goes to jail very rarely  though for a year  That is what you are seeing on Wall Street  
I think if it has worked very well for the credit unions  it can work for the private banks as well  
Mr  President  in the financial reform bill  did we address this issue  Yes  we did  and no  we didn't  We said the credit card companies have to be clearer and more honest about their interest rates and how much borrowing money will actually cost because before they would say  You will get a zero interest rate or a 2-percent interest rate  but most people didn't read the small print on page 4 that said they could raise interest rates at any time  
We have made some progress on at least them being honest with the American people about what their credit card costs will be  but that is not enough  What we have to do is put a cap on interest rates  It has worked for the credit unions  I believe it can and should work for the big banks as well  
Mr  President  what I want to do now is just give you some examples about you know  sometimes here and I am guilty of it as well we talk in big numbers a billion here and a trillion there and it adds up  But I think it is also important to look at the flesh and blood that is out there  the real suffering people are experiencing  
A while back  what I did was I sent an e-mail out to people in Vermont  It was a very simple e-mail  It said  Tell me in your own words what is going on in your family  What is going on in your lives  in the midst of this terrible recession  
Again  it is important  Yes  we know unemployment is 9 8 percent and the real unemployment is 16 percent  50 million people don't have any health insurance  median family income has gone down  poverty has gone up  and 25 percent of our kids are on food stamps  It is important to know that stuff  But behind all of those statistics is flesh and blood and good people who are doing everything they can to survive with a shred of dignity in their lives  
I did this last year  I sent that e-mail out to my constituents in Vermont  and I said  Write back to me  Tell me in your own words what is going on in your lives  I cannot remember how many we received  but there were hundreds and hundreds of responses  It quite amazed me  Frankly  it was hard to read these letters from decent  good people about what was happening in their lives  
What I said to them was this  If it is OK with you  we will publish what you have written  We won't use your names  of course  I don't want to embarrass anybody  We will read some of these stories on the floor of the Senate  
That is what I did  I didn't read them all  but I read some of them because it is important for us sitting here inside the beltway not to forget what is going on in the real world  whether it is Hawaii  Vermont  California  or anyplace  
Here are letters from two mothers in Vermont  First is from a woman in a rural area  The second is from a single mother in a small city  In Vermont  frankly  we don't have too many big cities  In my very beautiful State  where I expect the weather is very cold today  our largest city is all of 40 000 people  That is Burlington  VT  and I was honored to have been the mayor of that city for 8 years  Certainly  the vast majority of our people live in towns of less than 1 000  and there are towns of 500  For a while  I lived in a town called Stanton  up in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont  which has probably 150 people in it  and that is not uncommon in Vermont  There are a lot of small towns  
Here are the two letters  
A woman in the rural area says  
My husband and I have lived in Vermont our whole lives  We have two small children  a baby and a toddler  and have felt fortunate to own our own house and land  But due to the increasing fuel prices  we have at times had to choose between baby food and diapers and heating fuel  
In Vermont  heating fuel gets up there when the weather gets 20 below zero  It is an expensive proposition  
Continuing  
We have run out of heating fuel three times so far  and the baby has ended up in the hospital with pneumonia two of the times  We tried to keep the kids warm with an electric space heater on those nights  but that just doesn't do the trick  My husband does what he can just to scrape enough money for car fuel each week  and we have gone from three vehicles to one just to try to get by without going further into debt  We were going to sell the house and rent  but the rent around here is higher than what we pay for our mortgage and property taxes combined  Please help  
That is what she asked of me and her government ``Please help '' She didn't ask me to lower taxes for billionaires  She is speaking for tens of millions of people in this country who are in desperate need of help  
Here is another letter that came from a woman who lives in a larger town  
I am a single mother with a 9-year-old boy  We lived this past winter without any heat at all  
That is not a good position to be in in Vermont in the winter  
Fortunately  someone gave me an old wood stove  I had to hook it up to an old unused chimney we had in the kitchen  I couldn't even afford a chimney liner  The price of liners went up with the price of fuel  To stay warm at night  my son and I would pull off all the pillows from the couch and pile them on the kitchen floor  I would hang a blanket from the kitchen doorway  and we would sleep right there on the floor  By February  we ran out of wood  and I burned my mother's dining room furniture  I have no oil for hot water  We boil our water on the stove and pour it into the tub  I would like to order one of your flags and hang it upside down at the Capitol building  We are certainly a country in distress  
Mr  President  what I will without doubt assure you is that those stories  in different forms and I know it is different in big cities than in a rural State such as Vermont  and I know it is different in Hawaii  where the Chair comes from  than in Boston  MA  But I am absolutely sure that millions of people in one way or another are telling the same story  These are great Americans  people who want to work and do the best they can by their kids  They are simply not making it right now  
This is the United States of America  in 2010  and people are going cold  People don't have enough food  People are homeless  My friends here are talking about huge tax breaks for billionaires  My friends here are talking about lowering rates on the estate tax for the top three-tenths of 1 percent of the American people  What are we talking about  What kinds of priorities are those  
Here is another letter from Vermont  This is not a woman in desperation  Those folks I just read from are  This woman says  
As a couple with one child  earning about $55 000 a year [which is  in Vermont  fairly decent] we have been able to eat out a bit  buy groceries and health insurance  contribute to our retirement funds  and live a relatively comfortable life financially  We have never accumulated a lot of savings  but our bills were always paid on time  and we never had any interest on our credit card  Over the last year  even though we have tightened our belts  not eating out much  watching purchases at the grocery store  not buying extras like a new TV  and repairing the washer instead of buying a new one doing all those things  we find ourselves with over $7 000 of credit card debt and are trying to figure out how to pay for braces for our son  I work 50 hours per week to help earn extra money to catch up  But that also takes a toll on the family life  Not spending those 10 hours at home with my husband and son makes a big difference for all of us  My husband hasn't had a raise in 3 years and his employer is looking to cut out any extra benefits they can to lower their expenses  which will increase ours  
How many millions of Americans do you think are saying exactly the same thing  
Let me read another story that comes from Vermont  
My 90-year-old father in Connecticut has recently become ill and asked me to visit him  I want to drop everything I am doing and go visit him  However  I am finding it hard to save enough money to add to the extra gas I will need to get there  I am self-employed with my own commercial cleaning service and money is tight  not only with gas prices but with everything  I make more than I did a year ago  and I don't have enough to pay my property taxes this quarter for the first time in many years  They are due tomorrow  
Here is another letter that I think deserves to be read  Mr  President  I think it would not hurt this body if every Member of the Senate I know we all get letters like this came down here and spent a couple of days talking about what is going on with working families in this country  Spouting statistics is good  and dealing with tax deals of $900 billion is fine  but I think we should reacquaint ourselves with the reality of life in America today  
This is what another constituent of mine writes  
My husband and I are retired and 65 years of age  We would have liked to work longer  but because of injuries caused at work and the closing of our factory to go to Canada  we chose to retire early  Now  with oil prices the way they are  we cannot afford to heat our home unless my husband cuts and splits wood  which is a real hardship as he has had his back fused and should not be working most of the day to keep up with the wood  Not only that  he has to get up two or three times each night to keep the fire going  
In other words  what she is talking about  is that in Vermont a lot of people heat with wood increasingly with pellets  an important source of fuel in the State of Vermont  What she is talking about is her husband  who is 65  with a bad back  has to go out and cut wood  and in their case  his being old  he has to get up two or three times a night to stoke the furnace that is keeping the house warm  Again  I would remind people that in Vermont it occasionally gets 20 or 30 below zero  
She continues  
We also have a 2003 car that we only get to drive to get groceries or go to the doctor or to visit my mother in the nursing home three miles away  It now costs us $80 a month to go nowhere  We have 42 000 miles on a 5-year-old car  
They can't afford to even use the car  I don't know what the price of gas is in Hawaii  Mr  President  but in Vermont it is now over $3 a gallon  A lot of people in my State have to travel long distances to get to work  Their cars need repairs  Cars break down  Cars require  in Vermont  compulsory insurance  They have to spend a whole lot of money just getting to work  I think we forget about that here  We don't need tax breaks for billionaires  we need to pay attention to these people  
She continues and concludes  
I have Medicare  but I can't afford prescription coverage unless I take my money out of an annuity  which is supposed to cover the house payment when my husband's pension is gone  We only eat two meals a day to conserve  
This is not some Third World country  This is the United States of Vermont the United States of America  my State of Vermont  and Vermont is better off today than a number of States around this country  You have these stories  and multiply them by 10 in every area of this country  
Here is another story  
Yesterday  I paid for our latest home heating fuel delivery  
Again  I am focusing now on the cost of fuel because in Vermont  where I come from  it is a big deal  So she writes  
Yesterday  I paid for our latest home fuel heating delivery $1 100  I also paid my $2 000-plus credit card balance  much of which bought gas and groceries for the month  
The point here  and then I will continue her letter  is that a lot of people use their credit cards not just as a nice and convenient way of not having to use cash when I go shopping  I am going to use my credit card and I will pay it off at the end of the month  What a nice thing  No  people are using their credit cards to buy food  to buy gas  and to buy the basic necessities of life  It is their only line of credit open  And then  as I mentioned earlier  they are charged 25 or 30 percent interest rates on what they owe  
She continues  
My husband and I are very nervous about what will happen to us when we are old  Although we have three jobs between us and participate in 403(b) retirement plans  we have not saved enough for a realistic post worklife if we survive to our life expectancy  As we approach the traditional retirement age  we are slowly paying off our daughter's college tuition loan and trying to keep our heads above water  We have always lived frugally  We buy used cars and store brand groceries  recycle everything  walk or car pool  when possible  and plastic our windows each fall  
What that means is that  in Vermont  if you don't have good storm windows  you put up plastic  It is a way to keep the wind out and keep the home warm  I know about that because I used to do that  
Even so  if and when our son decides to attend college  we will be in deep debt at age 65  Please  
And here she ends this  
P S  Please don't use my name  I live in a small town  and this is so embarrassing  
So embarrassing  We should be embarrassed  not her  We should be embarrassed that we are for one second talking about a proposal which gives tax breaks to billionaires while we are ignoring the needs of working families  low-income people  and the middle class  We should be embarrassed that we are not investing in our infrastructure  that we are not breaking up these large financial institutions  that we are not putting a cap on interest rates  that we are the only country in the world that does not have health care for all of our people of major countries  We should be embarrassed  not this wonderful woman who is trying to maintain her dignity  
Another letter from the State of Vermont  
I too have been struggling to overcome the increasing cost of gas  heating oil  food  taxes  et cetera  I have to say that this is the toughest year financially that I have ever experienced in my 41 years on this Earth  I have what used to be considered a decent job  I work hard  pinch my pennies  but the pennies have all but dried up  I am thankful that my employer understands that many of us cannot afford to drive to work 5 days a week  Instead  I work 3 15-hour days  I have taken odd jobs to try to make ends meet  This winter  after keeping the heat just high enough to keep my pipes from bursting  
One of the problems you have  when you live in a rural State and it gets cold  your pipes can burst  and then you have to spend a fortune getting them repaired  
She continues  
The bedrooms are not heated and never go above 30 degrees  
What happens in Vermont  if you have a home  in the wintertime  and you don't have a whole lot of money  you kind of close off rooms in the house because you can't afford to heat the whole house  So people live in a smaller area  
She continues  
I began selling off my woodworking tools  snow blower  pennies on the dollar  and furniture that had been handed down in my family from the early 1800s just to keep the heat on  Today  I am sad  broken and very discouraged  I am thankful the winter cold is behind us for a while but now gas prices are arising yet again  I just can't keep up  
That is the story from one person in Vermont  But that is the story for millions and millions of Americans  
Another story  And the reason I am reading these stories and I appreciate my staff bringing this booklet down here is this puts flesh and blood and real life into the statistics  The statistics are frightening enough  but this tells us what happens when the middle class of this country collapses  It tells us what happens when people lose decent-paying jobs  It tells us what happens when the government does not provide the kind of basic support system that it should for people in need  
Here is another letter  
As a single parent  I am struggling every day to put food on the table  
Mr  President  this is the United States of America and people are talking  in my State of Vermont and all over the country  about struggling to put food on the table  What comes to my mind now and I don't know if you saw them  Mr  President are some articles in the paper that talked about because of the bailing out of Wall Street  and the fact that Wall Street is now again profitable  these executives there are now making more money than they made before the bailout  and they go into restaurants and they pay thousands of dollars for a bottle of wine  pay hundreds and hundreds of dollars for some fancy dinner  Yet in my State and all over this country there are people who are wondering where their next meal is coming from  
She continues  
Our clothing all comes from thrift stores  I have a 5-year-old car that needs work  My son is gifted and talented  I tried to sell my house to enroll him in a school that had curriculum available for his special needs  After 2 years on the market  my house never sold  The property taxes have nearly doubled in 10 years  
Let me pick up on that point  We don't deal with property taxes here I did when I was a mayor but if we are not adequately funding education  if we do not adequately help cities and towns all over this country in terms of fire protection and in terms of police protection and housing  a lot of that burden falls on the very regressive property tax  which in my State of Vermont is very high  And you find it referred to time and time again that property taxes are going up  Property taxes are going up  
She writes  
Property taxes have nearly doubled in 10 years  And the oil to heat is prohibitive  To meet the needs of my son  I have left the house sit and moved into an apartment near his high school  I don't go to church many Sundays because the gasoline is too expensive to drive there  
Imagine  She doesn't go to church on Sundays because the gasoline is too expensive to drive there  
Every thought of an activity is dependent upon the cost  I can only purchase food from dented can stores  
Does anybody in this Congress know what a dented can store is  Do you know that many people buy their groceries and they get them cheaper because the cans are dented  Most Members of the Senate and the House  most Governors do not get their meals from dented cans  but huge numbers of Americans do  
She then concludes  
I am stretched to the breaking point with no help in sight  
By the way  the letters that I received  when I asked for letters  came not just from the State of Vermont most came from Vermont but some came from other areas  I will read another from Vermont and then one from rural Pennsylvania  
This one from Vermont  
Due to illness  my ability to work has been severely limited  I am making $10 an hour  and if I am lucky  I get 35 hours a week of work  
Let me pull away from the letter  That is not an unusual wage in the State of Vermont  That is not an unusual wage all over America  That is what people earn  $10 an hour  times 40 hours  He doesn't get 40 hours  He makes $350 a week  Ten times 40  400  times 50  $21 000 a year  Shock of all shocks  that is reality  That is what people are trying to live on  Those are the people that we should be helping  not the CEOs on Wall Street who will get $1 million a year in a tax break if this deal goes through  Not the people who are in the top three-tenths of 1 percent  who our Republican friends want to help by repealing the estate tax  which will cost us $1 trillion in 10 years  Maybe we should concentrate on helping people who are trying to get by eating food from dented cans or people who can't afford to drive to church on Sunday because they can't afford the price of a gallon of gas  Maybe we should remember who sent us here and who made this country  
She writes  
I am making $10 an hour  and if I am lucky I get 35 hours a week of work  At this time  I am only getting 20 hours  as it is off season in Stowe  
Stowe  VT  is a beautiful town  I hope everybody comes to visit us up there  There is great skiing  but it is a resort town  Big time in the winter  We are doing better in the summer  but it is a resort town  Resorts get more business in the winter than summer and less time elsewhere  
So what she is talking about is that it is off season up there and she is only getting 20 hours a week of work at $10 an hour  
She writes  
It does not take a mathematician to do the figures  
I am sorry  this is a man  not a woman  
How are my wife and I supposed to live on a monthly take-home income of less than $800 a month  We do it by spending our hard-earned retirement savings  I am 50 and my wife is 49  At the rate we are going  we will be destitute in just a few years  The situation is so dire it is all that I can think about  Soon I will have to start walking to work an 8-mile round trip because the price of energy is so high that it is either that or going without heat  
This is a 50-year-old guy  making $10 an hour  20 or 30 hours a week  and his choice is either walking 8 miles to and from his job in Stowe or else not heating his home  And this happens in Vermont all of the time  It is quite unbelievable  
He says  
As bad as our situation is  I know many in worse shape  We try to donate food when we do our weekly shopping  but now we are not able to even afford to help our neighbors eat  What has this country come to  
I don't know about other parts of the country  I am sure it is the same  But if you go to a grocery store  there is often a bin out there in front where people buy food and they drop a can of peas or a can of corn or something into it  Here is a guy who is now faced with the reality of having to walk 8 miles to and from work and he is upset at himself that he does not have the money to buy food for his neighbors who he thinks are even worse off than he is  That is the good people of Vermont and America  They are all over this country  good and decent people who do worry about their neighbors  
Then you have the lobbyists here representing the largest corporations in the world where the CEOs make tens of millions of dollars a year and their job is to squeeze the middle class and these families harder and harder  cut back on their benefits in order to give tax breaks to the richest people in this country  What a difference in attitude  A poor man faced with the choice of either walking 8 miles to and from his job or losing his heat  worried about his neighbors  and you have the lobbyists here worrying about the richest people in the world and winning  And winning  
Then I got a letter that comes not from Vermont  it comes from rural Pennsylvania  
I am 55 years old and worse off than my adult children  I have worked since age 16  I don't live from paycheck to paycheck  I live day to day  I can only afford to fill my gas tank on my payday  Thereafter I put $5  $10  whatever that I can  I cannot afford to buy the food items that I would  I am riding around daily  to and from work  with a quarter of a tank of gas  This is very scary  I can see myself working until the day that I die  
Trust me  the gentleman is talking about getting older  worrying about working until the day he dies  We are already seeing this  You go to grocery stores in Vermont and you see old people  who should be sitting home with their grandchildren  Do you know what they are doing  They are packing groceries  Then we have some geniuses on this deficit reduction commission  people who made their money on Wall Street  they have a brilliant idea  Let's raise the Social Security age to 68  69 years old so that people like this will have to work  in fact  to the day they die  
He continues  This is not from Vermont  This is from Pennsylvania  
I do not have savings  no credit cards and my only resources are through my employment  I have to drive to work as there are no buses from my residence to work  I don't know how much longer I can do this  I am concerned as gas prices climb daily  I am just tired  The harder that I work the harder it gets  I work 12 to 14 hours daily and it just doesn't help  
I am not saying every person in America is experiencing these stories  They are not  A lot of people are doing fine  They have good jobs  Their kids are doing well  They are taking care of their parents  A lot of people are doing just fine  But we would be fools and dishonest not to understand the reality of what is going on in this country  It breaks my heart  and I know it breaks the hearts of millions of people in this country  to see what is going on in this great Nation of ours  that so many people are hurting  that so many parents I don't know if I have that letter or if it is in another booklet  I will never forget one letter I received  and that is these people my parents never went to college  My father never graduated high school  They wanted their kids to get an education; that is what they wanted and we did  It was very important  and how proud my mother was of that  
We get letters from people who say  You know  I dreamed that my kid  my daughter  would go to college  and she is not going to go to college now  She is not going to go to college  
It is just painful to even talk about and think about  the direction in which this country is moving  So I want to now take a break from reading these letters  Actually  the truth is  when these letters came in a year ago I could not read more than a half dozen at a time  They took too much out of me  They take something out of you to hear people you know  good people  honest people I hear from some of my colleagues here that people are lazy  My God  people work so hard in the State of Vermont  We have I don't know how many thousands of people are not working just two or three jobs  they work four jobs  It is all over this country  Whatever you say about the United States of America  the people of our country are not lazy  That is one thing you can say about them  
In fact  according to all of the bloodless statistics  our people today work longer hours than do the people of any other major country on Earth  Did you know that  I don't know that a lot of Americans know that  It used to be Japan  The Japanese are a very hard-working people  Now it turns out that our people work harder  longer hours than do the people of any other country in the industrialized world  
When you think about that  when I think about the books that I read when I was in elementary school I remember there were pictures up there  I don't know if you remember these pictures  There were pictures where workers were demonstrating  and they said  We want a 40-hour workweek  Do you remember seeing those pictures  We want a 40-hour workweek  That was back in the early 1900s  
Today  100 years later  people still want a 40-hour workweek because they are forced to work 50 or 60 hours a week  They are working two jobs  They are working three jobs  
What I want to do now  before I get back to why I am on the Senate floor today  and why I have been here for a few hours which is to say the agreement negotiated by the President and the Republican leadership is not a good agreement  It is an agreement that we can improve upon  It is an agreement the American people can improve upon  But what I am asking the American people to do is to stand up  let your Senators  let your Congressman know how you feel  
Do you really believe millionaires and billionaires who have done phenomenally well in recent years need an extended tax cut at a time when their taxes have been lowered substantially in recent years  Do we really need to give tax breaks to the rich in order to drive up the national debt so our kids and grandchildren will pay higher taxes in order to pay off that national debt caused by tax breaks for the rich  
If you do not believe that  if you do not think that is right  let the President of the United States know about it  Let your Senator know about it  Let your Congressman know about it  We need a handful  seven or eight Members of the Senate to hear from their people  to say  Wait a minute  Don't hold my kids hostage  Don't force them to pay higher taxes in order to give tax breaks to the very rich  
If the American people stand up and by the millions let their Senators and Congressmen and the President know  we can win this thing  We can win this battle  It is not too late yet  That is what I hope will happen  
When we talk about why things go on the way they are here in Washington  and why so many people back home whether they are Democrats  Republicans  Independent whether they are conservatives  progressives  moderates  whatever they are there is a huge feeling of anger and frustration and  in fact  disgust at what goes on here in Washington  
I have just read some letters from people  You can multiply those letters by 1 million  People are saying  Don't you hear us  Don't you know what is going on in our lives  Don't you know the worries we have for our kids  for our parents  Aren't you listening to us  
In many ways I am afraid the Senate is not listening to them  nor is the House  nor is our Government  What worries me so much about this growing concentration of wealth and income in this country is that when the rich get richer  they don't just simply put their money under the mattress  They don't simply go out and buy yachts and planes and 18 homes and all the things rich people do  They do that  but they do something else  
They say  I am not rich enough  I need to be richer  What motivates some of these people is greed and greed and more greed  There is no end to it  So what they do is they do things like hire lobbyists who are all over Capitol Hill  These lobbyists  sometimes former leaders of the Republican Party  former leaders of the Democratic Party  former hotshot lawyers  bright people  their job is to make sure the legislation we pass such as this major tax bill that this legislation benefits not ordinary Americans  not the people whose letters I have just read  not those people  but the wealthiest people in this country and the largest corporations  
I want to just mention something  A very good friend of mine and I do a radio show every Friday afternoon I am afraid I missed it today Tom Hartman  Tom is the author of a number of wonderful books  
In his latest book  which is called ``Rebooting the American Dream  11 Ways to Rebuild Our Country '' Tom writes and he talks about lobbying  which is an issue we have to deal with in this country  He says  on page 104  
Given how lucrative lobbying is as an investment  it has become a huge business  
In other words  what he is talking about is  if you have a good lobbyist and the lobbyist changes a few words in a bill  your company or you as an individual can end up with huge amounts of money just by changing a few words  In this case  language that we are working on now is whether we extend the Bush tax breaks for the top 2 percent  for many millionaires and billionaires  Some lobbyists  representing the rich and the powerful  are determined to keep that language in there  
So it is an investment  So you spend a few million dollars  an organization spends a few million dollars on a lobbyist  but if you end up getting back hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks and corporate loopholes or other benefits  it is a very good investment  That is what Tom Hartman is writing  He says  
Given how lucrative lobbying is as an investment it has become a huge business  In February  2010  the Center for Responsive Politics laid out which industries had invested how much in Congress the previous year  Overall  it found that in 2009 the number of registered lobbyists who actively lobby Congress was 13 694 and the total lobbying spending  
Get this  Total lobbying spending in 2009 was $3 47 billion  a 240-percent increase since 1999  10 years  more than tripling it  I guess  In 2009 companies spent $3 47 billion in lobbying  We have 100 Members of the Senate  435 Members of the House  Listeners or viewers can get out their calculating machine and divide it up  how much money the big money interests are spending trying to influence Senator Inouye or myself or the other 98 Members of the Senate or 435 Members of the House  They are flooding this institution with money  
Let me give you just a breakdown of where that money is coming from  What they call miscellaneous business  that is retail and manufacturing  et cetera  $558 million in one year  2009; health care  $543 million  
By the way  that was before health care reform  My strong guess I will be very surprised if that number did not double  If you were a health care lobbyist this year  trust me  you are doing very well  They were all over this place  making sure we did not pass a strong health care bill  for example  in Medicare for all  a single-payer program  which I support  On top of that  you have the finance  insurance and real estate industries combined that spent $465 million  
And  again  that was before we dealt with financial reform  I suppose the recent legislation we dealt with  health care reform and financial reform  was a real boon to the lobbyists around here  because they can go out and earn their money  But that was before this  Finance  insurance  real estate  only spent $465 million in 1 year to influence 100 Members of the Senate and 435 Members of the House  
Energy and natural resources  Well  as I mentioned earlier today  ExxonMobil last year made $19 billion  paid nothing in taxes  got a $156 million refund  ExxonMobil and other companies are putting all kinds of money into phony organizations telling us that global warming is not real  we do not have to transform our energy system; costs a lot of money to do that  The energy and natural resources companies spent $408 million in 2009 alone  This is 1 year  folks  1 year  
Communications  electronics  Right now I am working on an issue which deals with the merger of Comcast and NBC  I think it is a bad idea  Comcast is the largest provider of cable services in America  huge role in the Internet  and NBC is one of the largest media conglomerates in America  What they are trying to do right now is to merge  these two huge companies  
I think the problem in America is we have too few companies controlling what goes on  We have too much of a concentration of ownership  and that merger is bad  Well  I can assure you for a fact  they have all of these lobbyists in the media industry  from communications  right here rallying  trying to do their best to make sure this merger and other type mergers take place $360 million from the communication and electronics industry  
Then we have other types of organizations as well  Bottom line  in the year 2009  they spent $3 47 billion  almost 3 1/2 billion  on lobbying  And you know what  you get what you pay for  
That is just lobbying  We are not talking about campaign contributions  We are not talking about the huge sums of money it now takes to run for office in the United States  and we are not talking about where that money comes from  We are not talking about the Citizens United horrendous decision reached by the Supreme Court which allows billionaires and all of these companies and their executives to put money into campaigns and not even have to be identified  We are not even talking about that  This is just lobbying  
So if you wonder why we are having a serious discussion about whether we should give tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires while the middle class is collapsing  and tens of millions of people have no health insurance  and we have the highest rate of children in poverty  and we have the most unequal distribution of wealth and income of any country  if you wonder how we would consider for 1 minute talking about more tax breaks for the rich  then you do not know much about what goes on here in Washington and you do not know about campaign contributions and the degree to which big money buys and sells politicians  
I want to review again the reason I am down here today  and I have been here for a few hours and voice my very strong opposition to the agreement that was reached between the Republican leadership and President Obama  I think the American people do not like this agreement  All I can tell you I do not know what is going on in your office  coming from Alaska  Mr  President  but I can tell you in the last 3 days  between phone calls and e-mails  I probably have gotten 5 000  We have heard from about 5 000 people  many from Vermont  some from out of State as well  
The opposition to this agreement is probably 99 percent  People cannot understand why in a million years  with a $13 7 trillion national debt  and a $1 4 trillion yearly deficit  we would be thinking for one second  for one second  about giving tax breaks to the richest people in this country who are already doing fabulously well  
I am down here today  and have been for a few hours  to urge my colleagues and  more importantly  the American people  to say no to this agreement  If we stand together  if the American people write or e-mail or call their Senators and their Congress people  I think we can turn this thing around  I think we can come up with an agreement that makes us all proud  rather than one that we have to be ashamed for  
I know there was an editorial back in the State of Vermont which I saw  I do not remember the exact title  but something to the effect of  This agreement stinks  it is odious  but it is better than nothing  Well  I do not think that has to be the choice  awful or better than nothing  I think the choice can actually be a good agreement  And I think if the American people stand with those of us who are opposing this agreement  we can pull this off  We can defeat this agreement and come up with a much better one  one that does not cause our kids and grandchildren to pay higher taxes in order to provide huge tax breaks for the richest people in this country  
In talking about the reasons I am opposed to this agreement  one of the other reasons is that while the President and the Republican leadership say  well  you know  this is just a temporary extension  it is going to be for 2 years  just temporary  you know and I know that when you talk about temporary here  it becomes long term and then perhaps becomes permanent  
If we extend these tax breaks for the top 2 percent now  my strong guess I hope I am wrong  I certainly hope this proposal is defeated  but if we extend them for 2 years  my strong guess is they will be  2 years from now  extended again  And depending upon the politics of what goes on here  they can be extended permanently  
Our Republican colleagues  as you well know  wanted to extend them for 10 years at a cost of $700 billion  An increase in our national debt  Our Republican friends are fighting hard to completely repeal the estate tax  which would cost us $1 trillion  $1 trillion in 10 years in increased national debt  
So the point I have got to make I want to emphasize this point  that when people talk about these things being short term  being temporary  take those thoughts with a grain of salt  Maybe that is the case  I do not think it is  I think once you move over the cliff and make that decision to extend these tax breaks  they are going to be extended long term  Here is the reason why  Right now the dynamic here is the President campaigned against these tax breaks  The President does not believe in extending these tax breaks for the rich  But he felt he had to make the compromise  I thought he made a bad compromise  
But our Republican friends are saying over and over that if you rescind  end these tax breaks to the rich  you are raising taxes 2 years from now in the midst of a Presidential campaign  when President Obama  if he is the Democratic candidate  says  Do not worry  I am going to oppose these extensions of tax breaks for the rich  his credibility has been severely damaged  and the American people know it  Can they trust him  That is what he told them then  That is what he will tell them in 2 years  Is he going to be believed  I do not think so  So these tax breaks  while ostensibly for 2 years may  in fact  be for a lot longer than that  
I would also say that while we have talked about primarily the discussion has centered around extending the tax breaks  personal income tax breaks to the very rich  there are other tax breaks in this proposal which are equally odious  
What this agreement between the President and the Republican leadership does is it extends the Bush era 15-percent tax rates on capital gains and dividends  meaning that those people who make their living off of their investments will continue to pay a substantially lower tax rate than firemen  teachers  and nurses  
Think about that  You are a big-time investor  You make most of your income off of capital gains or dividends  and you are paying a 15-percent tax rate  But if you are a worker doing something with your hands or you are a teacher or a fireman or you are a cop or nurse  a doctor  you are paying tax rates that are higher than that  We are extending those 15-percent tax rates on capital gains and dividends  
Then  on top of that  this agreement includes a horrendous proposal regarding the estate tax  The estate tax was enacted in 1916  and it was a proposal strongly supported by Teddy Roosevelt  who believed very strongly that it was not healthy for America to have an ongoing and evolving concentration of ownership  Here is what Teddy Roosevelt said in 1910  
The absence of effective State  and  especially  national  restraint upon unfair money-getting has tended to create a small class of enormously wealthy and economically powerful men  whose chief object is to hold and increase their power  The prime need is to change the conditions which enable these men to accumulate power which is not for the general welfare that they should hold or exercise ..... No man should receive a dollar unless that dollar has been fairly earned  Every dollar received should represent a dollar's worth of service rendered not gambling in stocks  but service rendered  The really big fortune  the swollen fortune  by the mere fact of its size acquires qualities which differentiate it in kind as well as in degree from what is passed by men of relatively small means  Therefore  I believe in a graduated income tax on big fortunes  and in another tax which is far more easily collected and far more effective a graduated inheritance tax on big fortunes  properly safeguarded against evasion and increasing rapidly in amount with the size of the estate  
How is that  One hundred years ago  That is what he said  I would say he got it right when he said that  It is even more true today  hence the estate tax  
Unfortunately  under the agreement reached by the President and the Republicans  the estate tax rate  which was 55 percent under President Clinton when the economy  by the way  was a heck of a lot stronger than it is today  will decline to 35 percent with an exemption on the first $5 million of an individual's estate and $10 million for a couple  
I made this point earlier  but I think it has got to be made over and over  Our Republican friends have renamed the estate tax the death tax  The implication of what they are saying  and what many Americans believe  is that if I have $100 000 in the bank or $50 000 in the bank and I die  my kids are going to have to pay a heavy estate tax on what I left them  But that is absolutely and categorically not the case  The estate tax applies only to the top three-tenths of 1 percent  This is not a tax on the rich  This is a tax on the very  very  very rich  And under this proposal  which benefits only the top three-tenths of 1 percent  the President and the Republicans agreed to lower the tax rate on the estate tax to 35 percent  with an exemption on the first $5 million  
That is wrong  Let me give you an example of who the folks are who will benefit from doing this  Many of my Republican colleagues have been pushing very hard  not just to lower the tax rate by the way  this 35 percent is lower  I think  than they ever dreamed they would get  with a $5 million exemption  but what they wanted ultimately  and I suspect will continue to fight for  is the complete repeal of the estate tax  
To give one example and I don't mean to pick on the Walton family  but just as a flesh-and-blood example Sam Walton's family  the heirs to the Walmart fortune  are worth  give or take  $86 billion  That is a lot of money  The Walton family would receive an estimated $32 7 billion tax break if the estate tax was completely repealed  Does anybody in their right mind believe that when this country has a national debt of $13 7 trillion and when we have the highest rate of childhood poverty in the industrialized world and our unemployment rate is 9 8 percent  can anybody for one second fathom Members of the Senate saying they want to give a $32 billion tax break to one family  
In terms of the estate tax  what we have done is made it even more regressive  We have given substantial help to exactly the people who need it the least  That is not what we should be doing  Our job and I know it is a radical idea should be to represent the vast majority of the people  the middle class  the working families  and not just the top 1 or 2 percent  This proposal  this lowering of the estate tax  which will cost our government substantial sums of money because the revenue is not going to come in  will benefit only the top three-tenths of 1 percent  
Again  if some of my Republican colleagues are successful in their desire and they are moving down the path if we repeal the estate tax entirely  which is what they want to do it is hard to believe  and some of the listeners out there think I am kidding  but I am deadly serious it will drive up the national debt by $1 trillion over a 10-year period  Lowering the estate tax rate and raising the exemption is clearly an onerous provision  
It is not only the Walton family of Walmart who will benefit  According to Forbes magazine  there are 403 billionaires living in this country with a combined net worth of $1 3 trillion  That is not shabby  That is pretty good  Anyone lucky enough to inherit this extraordinary wealth would benefit the most from repealing the estate tax  
As Robert Frank wrote in his book  Richistan'': 
The wealthiest people in this country accumulated so much wealth that they have been competing to see who could own the largest private yacht  who could own the most private jets  who could own the most expensive cars  jewelry  artwork  et cetera  In 1997  for example  Leslie Wexner  chairman of Limited Brands  the company that owns Victoria's Secret  
And none of us know what Victoria's Secret is  
paid a German shipmaker to build what was then the largest private yacht in the United States  It is called The Limitless  
There is a photo  It is a nice boat  It stretches 315 feet and has 3 000 square feet of teakwood and a gym  
According to Forbes magazine  Mr  Wexner is one of the wealthiest 400 people in this country  worth an estimated $2 3 billion  Permanently repealing the estate tax would allow Mr  Wexner's two children to inherit all of his wealth without paying a nickel to help this country deal with the enormous problems we have  
I wish Mr  Wexner I don't know him; I hope he is alive and well a long life  But I believe strongly that in this country  if we are going to see the middle class survive and our kids do well  we cannot repeal the estate tax and we cannot lower estate tax rates  
I wish to address another issue which I talked about earlier  I think there is some misunderstanding  The Presiding Officer raised this issue at a recent meeting we had  All over the country  people say  Isn't it great that we are going to lower the payroll tax on workers  We are going to go from 6 2 percent  which workers now pay  down to 4 2 percent  People are going to have more money in their pocket  which certainly is a good thing  It is going to cost $120 billion in Social Security payroll taxes  
Here is the point  Yes  we do want to put more money in workers' pockets  That is why many of us in the stimulus package supported a $400-a-year tax break for virtually every worker in America  That is what we said  We want people in these difficult times to have the money to take care of their families  When they have that money  they go out and spend it  When they spend it  it creates other jobs because people have to provide goods and services for them  It has a good  stimulative impact  We do want workers to have more money in their pockets  
While this idea of lowering the payroll tax sounds like a good idea  in truth  it really is not a good idea  This idea originated from very conservative Republicans whose intention from the beginning was to destroy Social Security by choking off the funds that go to it  This is not just Bernie Sanders' analysis  There was recently I distributed it recently at a meeting we held a news release that came from the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare  The headline on that press release is ``Cutting Contributions to Social Security Signals the Beginning of the End  Payroll Tax Holiday is Anything But '' What the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare  which is one of the largest senior groups in America  well understands is that there are people out there who want to destroy Social Security  And one way to do that is to divert funds into the Social Security trust fund and they don't get there  
What the President and others have said is not to worry  this is just a 1-year program just 1 year  In fact  they say  the General Treasury will pay the difference  So the Social Security trust fund is not going to lose funding  
The reason we have a $2 6 trillion surplus today in Social Security and the reason Social Security is good for the next 29 years to pay out all benefits is because it comes from the payroll tax  It is not dependent upon the whims of the Congress and the Treasury  
The President and Republicans said  This is just a 1-year program  Don't worry  
I do worry  I worry that once we establish this 1-year payroll tax holiday  next year our Republican friends will say  Do you want to end that  You are going to be raising taxes on workers  And enough people will support that concept  and this 1-year payroll tax holiday will become permanent  And when we do that  we will be choking off  over a period of years  trillions of dollars that we need to make sure Social Security is viable and is there for our children and grandchildren  
But don't listen to me  Listen to somebody who knows a lot more about this issue than I do  Barbara Kennelly is a former Congresswoman from Connecticut  She is the president and CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare  This is what Barbara Kennelly says  
Even though Social Security contributed nothing to the current economic crisis  it has been bartered in a deal that provides deficit busting tax cuts for the wealthy  Diverting $120 billion in Social Security contributions for a so-called tax holiday may sound like a good deal for workers now  but it is bad business for a program that a majority of middle class seniors will rely upon in the future  
The headline is ``Cutting Contributions to Social Security Signals the Beginning of the End '' 
This is not a good approach  Providing and figuring out a way that we can get more money into the hands of working people  as we did in the stimulus package  does make a lot of sense  Going forward with a payroll tax holiday is a backdoor method to end up breaking Social Security  It is not anything we should support  
Let me mention a quote from a gentleman who understands this issue very well  He understands the politics of what is going on here  His name Bruce Bartlett  former adviser for Presidents Reagan and George H W  Bush  He recently wrote the following in opposition to this payroll tax cut  This is what Mr  Bartlett wrote  
What are the odds that Republicans will ever allow this one-year tax holiday to expire  They wrote the Bush tax cuts with explicit expiration dates and then when it came time for the law they wrote to take effect exactly as they wrote it  they said any failure to extend them permanently would constitute the biggest tax increase in history  ..... if allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire is the biggest tax increase in history  one that Republicans claim would decimate a still-fragile economy  then surely expiration of a payroll tax holiday would also constitute a massive tax increase on the working people of America  Republicans would prefer to destroy Social Security's finances or permanently fund it with general revenues  
Switch the revenue base from the payroll tax to general revenues  
than allow a once-suspended payroll tax to be reimposed  Arch Social Security hater Peter Ferrara once told me that funding it with general revenues was part of his plan to destroy it by converting Social Security into a welfare program  rather than an earned benefit  He was right  
In other words  what this issue is about is breaking the bonds we have had since the inception of Social Security where Social Security was paid for by workers  You pay for it when you are working  and you get the benefits when you are old  That is the deal  There is no Federal money coming in from the General Treasury  
This gentleman  Mr  Bartlett  former adviser to Presidents Reagan and George H W  Bush  thinks and I suspect he is quite right this is the beginning of an effort to destroy Social Security  
The real debate about Social Security is not one about finances  
There has been a lot of misinformation and disinformation out there  I hear from some of my friends on the Republican side that Social Security is going bankrupt; it is not going to be there for our kids  That is absolutely not true  Social Security today has a $2 6 trillion surplus  Social Security can pay out every benefit owed to every eligible American  if we do not start diverting funds  for the next 29 years  at which point it pays out about 78 percent of benefits  So our challenge in 29 years is to fill that 22-percent gap  That it is  Can we do it  Sure we can  
President Obama  when he was campaigning  and I think he has repeated since  the very good suggestion that instead of having a cap in terms of which people contribute into the fund at $106 000  what we should do is do a bubble  and people who make $250 000 or more should contribute into the Social Security trust fund  If you did that and nothing else  you have essentially solved the Social Security problem for the next 75 years  Very easy  It is done  
So what this payroll tax holiday is doing  in my view  is pretty dangerous  I do not think enough people understand that  I think that is one of the strong reasons this agreement should be opposed  
Another reason I believe this agreement is not as good an agreement as we can get is that it provides tens and tens of billions of dollars in tax cuts for various types of businesses  I am not here to say these tax cuts cannot do some good  I suspect they can  But I think there is a lot better way to create the jobs we need than providing these particular business tax cuts  
Frankly  I think economists from almost all political spectrums conservative to progressive understand that if we are serious about creating the kinds of jobs this economy desperately needs and if we want to do that as rapidly and as cost-effectively as we possibly can  the way to do that is not to provide business tax cuts because right now right now corporate America is sitting on close to $2 trillion cash on hand  They have a ton of money  The problem is the products they are creating are not being bought by the American people because the American people do not have the money to buy those goods and services  
So if we are serious about creating the jobs we need  I think what we have to do is start making significant investments in our crumbling infrastructure; that is  rebuilding our bridges  our roads  our water systems  broadband  cell phone service  public transportation  our rail system  dams  In every single one of these areas  we are seeing our infrastructure crumbling  
The point is  if you simply ignore a crumbling infrastructure and I say this as a former mayor who dealt with this issue if you simply ignore a crumbling infrastructure  do you know what  it does not get better all by itself  
I know many mayors and Governors would very much like to think they could turn their backs on the infrastructure because it is not a sexy investment  It is not a sexy investment  But the reality is  if you do not pay attention to it today  it only gets worse and it costs you more money  It is like having a cavity  You can get your cavity filled  If you neglect it  as I have  and you end up doing a root canal  it is far more painful  far more expensive  That is what it is about  Do we maintain our infrastructure  Clearly  we have not  According to the American Society of Civil Engineers  we should be spending about $2 2 trillion in the next 5 years in order to maintain our infrastructure  
I say to the Presiding Officer  I do not know about Alaska I spent a very brief time in the Presiding Officer's beautiful State but I do know in Vermont we have bridges all over our State that are in desperate need of repair  It is fair to say that the stimulus package has been very positive for my State  We are spending more money on roads and bridges  But we have a long way to go  So we are putting money into our roads and bridges  We are hiring people to do that work  That is what we should be doing all over the country  
But it is not just roads and bridges  It is water systems  I told this story  I guess a few hours ago now  about a mayor  the mayor of Rutland  VT  which is the second largest city in the State  I was in his office and he showed me a pipe  and the pipe was in pretty bad shape  He said  You know  this pipe was laid by an engineer who then  after he did this  went off to war  And he said  What war do you think he went off to fight  And he said it was the Civil War the Civil War  So this was pipe laid in Rutland  VT  which is still being used  which was laid  I am guessing  in the 1850s  maybe 1860s  And it is not just Rutland  VT  
When I was mayor of Burlington  we had to spend $50 million  back then  20 years ago  I think  rebuilding our wastewater plants and making sure that a lot of pollution and filthy water did not get into our beautiful lake  Lake Champlain  It was an expensive proposition  But right now  we are going to have to invest in that  It is our water systems  our dams  our levees  our roads  our bridges  
I mentioned earlier and contrasted what was going on in infrastructure in the United States as opposed to China  and I quoted from a book called ``Third World America '' written by Arianna Huffington  who tells us  essentially  if we do not get our act together  that is what we will become a third world country  
She points out that compared to countries such as China  our investments in rail are absolutely pathetic and inadequate  In China  right now  that country is investing billions and billions of dollars in high-speed rail  building thousands and thousands of miles of high-speed rail  They are building over 100 new airports  And what are we doing  
So one of my many objections to the proposal struck between the President and the Republican leadership is I think we can do better in job creation than in business tax cuts  There is a time and a place for business tax cuts  and I am not against them  But I would say that at this particular moment in American history  at this particular moment  it makes a lot more sense to create  over a period of years  millions of jobs rebuilding our rail system  our subways  our roads  our bridges  and our water systems  and many other aspects of our infrastructure  
There are places in Vermont and throughout this country where people cannot today get decent-quality broadband service  cannot get cell phone service  In that area  we are behind many other countries  not wealthy countries around the world  When we make those investments in infrastructure  we not only create jobs  but we make our country stronger and more productive  and we enable ourselves to compete effectively in the international economy  
Another one of my objections to this proposal and why I think we can do a lot better is that I was really quite disturbed to hear the President and others  who defend this proposal  talk about that one of the ``compromises'' that was struck was to extend unemployment benefits for 13 months  
To my mind  as I have said earlier  at a time of deep recession  at a time of terribly high unemployment  it would be absolutely wrong and immoral for us to turn our backs on the millions of workers who are about to lose their unemployment benefits  If we do that  it is hard to imagine what happens to those families  for many of whom this is their only source of income  What do they do  Do they lose their homes  Do they move out onto the streets  How do they take care of their kids  I do not know  There are parts of this country where it is very hard to get a job  Extended unemployment is at the highest level I think we have ever seen  You cannot turn your backs on those families  
But I get upset when I hear that the Republican's willingness to support an extension of unemployment benefits for 13 months is a major compromise  I will tell you I think a lot of the American people do not know this that for the past 40 years 40 years  four decades under both Democratic and Republican administrations  whenever the unemployment rate has been above 7 2 percent and today we are at 9 8 percent unemployment always  whether the Democrats were in control  the Republicans were in control  
the President was Democrat  the President was Republican  what people did was say  We have to extend unemployment benefits  It is kind of common sense  It is not partisan  So when you have a program that has existed for 40 years in a bipartisan effort  it sounds to me that it is not much of a compromise for the Republicans to say  OK  we will do what Democrats and Republicans have done for 40 years  What a major compromise  It is not a compromise  It is just continuing existing bipartisan policy  which is sensible  It is sensible from a moral perspective  You cannot leave fellow American families out high and dry  
It is good economics because what the economists tell us is the people who will spend that money quickest are people who receive unemployment compensation because that is all they have  They are going to go out and buy  and when they buy from the neighborhood store  they create jobs  So it is good economics  and it is the moral thing to do  
But  frankly  in my view  this is not much of a compromise  This is just continuing four decades of existing policies  
As I said earlier  there are very clearly positive parts of this agreement  no question about it  I think almost every American will tell you that it would be totally absurd I know there are some who disagree  but I think the vast majority of Americans believe that in a time when the middle class is collapsing  when median family income has gone down  when unemployment is high  that it would be a real horror show if we did not extend the Bush tax breaks for the middle class  for 98 percent of the American people 98 percent  That is what we want  
We could have crafted it much tighter  couldn't we have  We could have said  Nobody above $100 000  nobody above $150 000  That is pretty generous  We said a family earning up to $250 000 should get an extension of these tax breaks  That is 98 percent of the American people  and that is not good enough for our Republican friends  They are fighting tooth and nail to make sure the top 2 percent the millionaires and billionaires  the CEOs who earn tens of millions a year they are fighting it is as if they are at war  They are so engaged to make sure these fabulously wealthy people receive at least $1 million  in some cases  For people who are making $1 million a year  they are going to receive  on average  $100 000 a year in tax breaks  For the very  very wealthiest  it could be over $1 million a year  
I say to the Presiding Officer  I know you joined me just 2 days ago in saying that at a time when senior citizens in this country and disabled vets  for 2 years in a row  had not received any COLA  that maybe it was the right thing to do because we know that health care costs and prescription drug costs are soaring that maybe we should provide a $250 check for those seniors and disabled veterans one time one time  I could not get one Republican vote in support of that proposition  We won 53 to 45  but around here it does not take 50 votes to win; it does not take a majority to win; it takes 60 votes  We could not get one Republican vote  So here you have every Republican voting against a $250 check for a disabled vet or a senior citizen who is living on $15 000  $16 000 a year  Cannot afford it  But we can afford a million-dollar-a-year tax break for somebody who is worth hundreds of millions of dollars  
Now  somebody may understand that rationale  I don't  I really don't  I can't understand it  I can't understand asking our kids and grandchildren to pay more in taxes  and the national debt goes up in order to provide tax breaks for the richest people in this country  
So while there are some good provisions in this bill certainly extending the tax breaks for 98 percent of our people  for the very broad middle class; I think if the American people demand it  in our democracy we can do better  I don't know if the Presiding Officer or I alone will be able to convince some of our Republican friends or maybe some of our Democratic friends to make this into the kind of proposal we need for the working families of this country  and for our children  for our next generation  I don't know if we can do it inside this beltway  
As I said earlier  I think the way we win this battle  the way we defeat this proposal and come back with a much better proposal is when millions of Americans start writing and e-mailing and calling their Senators  their Congress people  and say  Wait a second  Are you nuts  Do you really think millionaires and billionaires need a huge tax break at a time when this country has a $13 7 trillion national debt  What are you smoking  How could you for one second think that makes any sense whatsoever  
I will tell the Presiding Officer something  I don't know what my phones are doing today in my office right now  But in the last 3 days we have gotten  I am guessing  5 000 phone calls and e-mails  and about 99 percent of them are in disagreement with this proposal  
I am looking at a chart  We have gotten 2 100 calls that just came in today  I don't know what kind of calls other Members of the Senate are getting  but certainly those are the calls I am getting  
This point cannot be made strongly enough  What our Republican friends want to do and they have been pretty honest and up front about it  especially some of the extreme  rightwing people who have been running for office and  in some cases  have won they have been honest enough to say they want to bring this country back to where we were in the 1920s  Their ultimate aim is the basic repeal of almost all of the provisions that have been passed in the last 70 years to protect working people  the elderly  and children  They believe in a Darwinian-style society in which you have the survival of the fittest; that we are not a society which comes together to take care of all of us  You take care of me in need and I take care of you and your family; that we are one people  Their strategy is pretty clear  They want to ultimately destroy Social Security  
What we are beginning to hear more and more of is why don't we raise the retirement age to 68 or 69  That deficit reduction commission  which I thought was the people on that commission were bad appointees by the President  We could have put together some good economists to say how do we in a fair way in a fair way address the deficit and national debt crisis  That wasn't what that commission did  So these folks are talking about major cuts in Social Security  Medicare  Medicaid  
At a time when it is so hard for young people to afford to go to college  they want to raise the costs by asking our young people while they are in college to be accruing the interest on their loans  
So I think if the President believes that if this agreement is passed  the Republicans are going to come to the table and we are all going to live happily in the future  we are all going to work together in a nonpartisan way  I think he is not understanding the reality  These people are going to come back and they are going to come back very aggressively for major cuts in Social Security  Medicare  Medicaid  environmental protection  education  childcare  Pell grants  you name it  because their belief is I don't quite understand it that it is somehow good public policy to give tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country who  in many ways  have never had it so good  while you cut programs that the middle class and working families of this country desperately depend upon  
So I would suggest that this big debate we are having right now on whether we should accept the proposal agreed to by the President and the Republicans is just the beginning of what is coming down the pike  If we surrender now on this issue  we can expect next month and the following month another governmental crisis  another threat of a shutdown  unless they get their way  So I think rather than asking the working families of this country to have to compromise  instead of asking our kids to pay more in taxes to bail out billionaires  maybe I know this is a radical idea but maybe we should ask a handful of our Republican friends to join us  Maybe a handful of honest conservatives over there who have been telling us for years their great concerns about deficit spending and a huge national debt  maybe they should be prepared to vote against the proposal which raises the national debt and our deficit by giving tax breaks to some of the richest people in the world  
Quite frankly  I don't think I am going to be able to convince them  I don't know that the Presiding Officer is going to be able to convince them  But I think their constituents can convince them  I think the American people can convince them  I think  as I said earlier  if the American people stand up  we can defeat this proposal and we can create a much better proposal  
Clearly  we must extend tax breaks for the middle class  Clearly  we must make sure unemployed workers continue to get the benefits they desperately need  But equally  clearly  we must make sure we are not raising the national debt which  as sure as I am standing here  will result in cuts in Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid and education and other programs if this proposal is passed  
So this is not only an important proposal unto itself  $900 billion plus even in Washington is nothing to sneeze at  But it is an important proposal in terms of the direction in which our country goes into the future  If we accept this proposal of a 2-year extension for the richest people in America  I believe it will eventually become either a long-term extension or a permanent extension  If we accept the proposal that lowers the rates on the estate tax which benefits only the top three-tenths of 1 percent 99 7 percent of Americans get nothing but if we give them what they want  I believe over a period of years it will lead to the complete abolishment and ending of the estate tax which will cost us over $1 trillion over a 10-year period  
So I hope this issue is not one just progressives or moderates feel strongly about  I hope honest conservatives  who in their heart of hearts believe this country is seriously in danger when we have unsustainable deficits and a huge national debt  will tell their elected officials here in Washington not to pass a piece of legislation which increases the national debt significantly and  in fact  will allow for the permanent over years  in my view extension of these tax breaks  
So that is what this debate is about  It is about fundamentally whether we continue the process by which the richest people in this country become richer  at a time when we have the most unequal distribution of income and wealth of any major country on Earth  
As I have said earlier  this is not an issue that is discussed I don't know well  I do know why  It is just not an issue that people feel comfortable talking about because they don't want to give affront to their wealthy campaign contributors or take on the lobbyists who are out there  But that is the reality  Throughout the entire world  the United States has the most unequal distribution of income  The top 1 percent is earning 23 5 percent of all income  That is more than the bottom 50 percent  That is not just immoral  it is bad economics because if the middle class gets crushed entirely  who is going to be buying the goods and services produced in this economy  
So this piece of legislation  as important as it is unto itself and it is very important is equally important in terms of what it says about where we are going into the future  Are we going to protect the middle class and working families of our country  Are we going to make sure every young person in America  regardless of income  has the ability to go to college  or are we going to allow college to become unaffordable for hundreds and hundreds of thousands of bright  young people  or else force them to  leave school deeply in debt  
Are we going to create a health care system which guarantees health care to all of our people high-quality health care or are we going to continue a situation where 45 000 Americans die each year because they don't have access to a doctor  Are we going to invest in our energy system so we break our dependence on foreign oil  We spend about $350 billion a year importing oil from Saudi Arabia and other foreign countries almost $1 billion a day which should be used to make this country energy independent  which should be used to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel into energy efficiency and sustainable energy  technologies such as wind  solar  geothermal  and biomass  
By the way  none of that has been addressed  as I understand it  in this proposal  
So my point is not just that this proposal is a bad proposal as it stands before us now  but it is going to move us in the future in a direction that I do not believe this country should be going  
I mentioned earlier my own personal family's history is the history of millions and millions of Americans  My father  as it happened  came to this country at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket  He worked hard his whole life  He never made very much money  but he and my mom my mom graduated high school; she never went to college had the satisfaction  the very significant satisfaction  of knowing their kids got a college education  My older brother Larry went to law school  and I graduated from the University of Chicago  
I think what is going on in this country and why the anxiety level is so high is not just that people are worried about themselves parents worry more about their kids than they do about themselves  But what parents are sitting around and worrying about now is they are saying  Will  for the first time in the modern history of this country  my kids have a lower standard of living than their parents  
Will my kids earn less income  Will my kids not have the education I have  Will my kids not have the opportunity to travel and learn and grow as I have done  Are the best days of America behind us  That is really the question  I don't think that has to be the case  
But I will tell my colleagues  as I mentioned earlier  if we are going to change the national priorities in this country  if we are going to start devoting our energy and our attention to the needs of working families and the middle class  we have to defeat this proposal and we have to defeat similar types of proposals which come down the pike  When this country has a $13 7 trillion national debt  it is insane nothing less than insane to be talking about huge tax breaks for people who don't need them  Again  as I mentioned earlier  ironically  we have a lot of these millionaires out there who apparently love their country more than some of the people in this Chamber  
You have some of the richest people in America Bill Gates and all the good  charitable work he does  and Warren Buffet and many others who are saying  I am doing just fine  I am a billionaire or a multimillionaire  I don't need your tax breaks  I am worried about the fact that we have the highest rate of childhood poverty; invest in our children  I am worried that our infrastructure is crumbling; invest in our infrastructure  I am worried that 45 000 Americans are dying this year who don't have access to health care; invest in health care  I am worried about global warming; invest in transforming our energy system  These are patriotic Americans  They love their country  They are saying to us  We don't even want it  
So we are giving money to people who  in some cases  don't even want it  I do know there are others out there who do want it  I think if there is one issue that we as a Congress and a government have to address  it is the extraordinary level of greed in this country  We have to stand tall and draw a line in the sand and simply say  Enough is enough  How much do you want  How much do you need  How many yachts can you own  How many homes can you have  Isn't it enough that the top 1 percent now earns 23 5 percent of the income in this country  How much more do they want  Do they want 30 percent  35 percent  Isn't it enough that the top 1 percent owns more wealth than the bottom 90 percent  How much more do they need  
I mentioned earlier  when I talked about the situation that got us into this horrendous recession and that is the collapse of Wall Street I talked about what I think most Americans understand very well; that is  the incredible greed and recklessness and dishonesty that exists on Wall Street  We must not allow ourselves to encourage and continue the kind of greed we have seen in recent years  It is an abomination that the people who caused this economic crisis the worst recession since the Great Depression that the people on Wall Street who caused it are now earning more money than they did before we bailed them out  
Earlier today  I was reading some e-mails that came to my office from Vermonters who were struggling to keep their heads above water  They were terribly painful and poignant stories about honest  good  decent people who are now choosing whether they should put gas in their car or buy the food or prescription drugs they need  It is not just a Vermont story; it is an American story  It is a reality out there for tens of millions of Americans  
In my view  we can negotiate a much better agreement than the one President Obama and the Republican leadership did  There are some good parts of that agreement  which obviously should be retained and perhaps even strengthened  Those include  of course  making sure we extend unemployment benefits to those who need it and  of course  that we extend tax breaks for the middle class  There are some very good other provisions in there which I think are worthwhile  
I think if the American people stand and agree with those of us who say no more tax breaks for the very wealthiest people in this country  we can defeat this proposal  and we can come up with a much better one that is fairer to the middle class of this country and is fairer to our young children  
I do not want to see our young kids my children and grandchildren have a lower standard of living than their parents  That is not what America is about  What I think we have to do is defeat this proposal  I think we have to urge our fellow Americans to stand and say no to tax breaks for those who don't need it  I think we have to work in a very serious way about creating the millions and millions of good-paying jobs that this country desperately needs  I personally believe that is a far more effective approach than giving the variety of business taxes that were in this proposal at a time when corporate America is sitting on $2 million of unused cash  They have the money  I think a much better approach  as I said earlier  is investing in our crumbling infrastructure  I think that makes us healthier and stronger as a nation for the future and in the global economy  
I think it creates jobs quicker and in a more cost-effective way than these tax cuts  I also think it is high time the American people move they want us to move in an entirely new direction in terms of trade  I am always amazed how Republicans and Democrats alike and I speak as the longest serving Independent in Congress come election time  have ads on television saying  Oh  we have to do something about outsourcing and about our trade policy  But somehow  the day after the election  when corporate America continues to throw American workers out on the street and moves to China  moves to other low-wage countries  that discussion ceases to exist and that legislation never seems to appear  
So it seems to me we have to defeat this proposal  and that in defeating this  we are going to tell the American people there are at least some of us here who understand what our jobs and obligations are; that is  that we are supposed to represent them  the middle class of the country  and not just wealthy campaign contributors or bow to the interests of the lobbyists who are all over this place  
When I talked a moment ago about the need to invest in our infrastructure as a way to create jobs  being more cost-effective than some of these business tax breaks  I am looking now at a Wall Street Journal article of December 9  2010  Here is the headline  ``Companies Clinging to Cash; Coffers Swell to 51-year High as Cautious Firms Put Off Investing in Growth '' 
That is a story by Justin Lahart  Here is the story  It makes the point I have been trying to express  
Corporate America's cash pile has hit its highest level in half a century  Rather than pouring their money into building plants or hiring workers  nonfinancial companies in the United States are sitting on $1 93 trillion in cash  
I said $2 trillion  but it is $1 93 trillion in cash  
--and other liquid assets at the end of September  up from $1 8 trillion at the end of June  the Federal Reserve said Thursday  Cash accounted for 7 4 percent of the companies' total assets  the largest share since 1959  The cash buildup shows the deep caution many companies feel about investing in expansion  while the economic recovery remains painfully slow  and high unemployment and battered household finances continue to limit consumers' ability to spend  
What have we been talking about  The Wall Street Journal is not my favorite paper  but they are saying that the way you are going to get the economy moving again is to put money in the hands of working people  who will then go out and buy the goods and services these companies produce  I have my doubts about whether these tax rates will  in fact  have the desired result  
As I said earlier  and will say again  I think the most effective way to create jobs  and the most important way  is to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure  That is our roads  bridges  rail system  water system  wastewater plants  our dams  levees  and the need to improve broadband to make sure every community in America has access to good-quality broadband and access to cell phone service  Unfortunately  as best as I can understand  there has not been one nickel appropriated in this proposed legislation that would go to infrastructure improvements  
I think this proposal should be defeated because it is not a strong proposal for the middle class  It is a proposal that gives much too much to people who don't need it  and it is a proposal that I think sets the stage for similar-type proposals down the pike  I apologize to anybody who has been listening for any length of time  I know I have been  to say the least  a bit repetitious  
But the concern is that when the President and some of my Republican colleagues talk about some of these tax breaks being temporary  we are just going to extend them for 2 years  talking about this payroll tax holiday being just 1 year  I have been in Washington long enough to know that assertion doesn't fly; that what is temporary today is long-term tomorrow and is permanent the next day  I fear very much that this proposal is bad on the surface  I fear very much that this proposal will lead us down a very bad track in terms of more trickle-down economics  which benefits the tricklers and not the ordinary Americans  I think it is a proposal that should be defeated  
The point I wish to make is that is not just my point of view  I think it should be defeated  I think we can do a lot better  I have to tell you the calls that are coming into my office are here is what we got today  2 122 calls oppose the deal  and I think 100 calls are supportive of the deal  You can do the arithmetic on it  At least 95 percent of the calls I got today are saying this is not a good deal  We can do better  
I know that in the last 3 or 4 days we have gotten probably 6 000 or 7 000 calls that say this  This is not just Vermont many of those calls come from out of State  by the way  But I think that is true all over this country  
Let me conclude  It has been a long day  Let me simply say I believe the proposal that was developed by the President and the Republicans is nowhere near as good as we can achieve  I don't know that we are able ourselves to get the handful of Republicans we need to say no to this agreement  I do believe that if the American people stand by the way  it may not just be Republicans  There may be some Democrats as well  If the American people stand and say  We can do better than this; we don't need to drive up the national debt by giving tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires  that if the American people are prepared to stand and we are prepared to follow them  I think we can defeat this proposal and come up with a better proposal which reflects the needs of working-class and middle-class families of our country and  to me  most importantly  the children of our country  
With that  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum 
In his inaugural remarks in January 1937  in the midst of the Great Depression  President Franklin Delano Roosevelt looked out at the nation and this is what he saw 
He saw tens of millions of its citizens denied the basic necessities of life 
He saw millions of families trying to live on incomes so meager that the pall of family disaster hung over them day by day 
He saw millions denied education  recreation  and the opportunity to better their lot and the lot of their children 
He saw millions lacking the means to buy the products they needed and by their poverty and lack of disposable income denying employment to many other millions 
He saw one-third of a nation ill-housed  ill-clad  ill-nourished 
And he acted  Against the ferocious opposition of the ruling class of his day  people he called economic royalists  Roosevelt implemented a series of programs that put millions of people back to work  took them out of poverty and restored their faith in government  He redefined the relationship of the federal government to the people of our country  He combatted cynicism  fear and despair  He reinvigorated democracy  He transformed the country 
And that is what we have to do today 
And  by the way  almost everything he proposed was called  socialist  Social Security  which transformed life for the elderly in this country was  socialist  The concept of the  minimum wage was seen as a radical intrusion into the marketplace and was described as  socialist  Unemployment insurance  abolishing child labor  the 40-hour work week  collective bargaining  strong banking regulations  deposit insurance  and job programs that put millions of people to work were all described  in one way or another  as  socialist  Yet  these programs have become the fabric of our nation and the foundation of the middle class 
Thirty years later  in the 1960s  President Johnson passed Medicare and Medicaid to provide health care to millions of senior citizens and families with children  persons with disabilities and some of the most vulnerable people in this county  Once again these vitally important programs were derided by the right wing as socialist programs that were a threat to our American way of life 
That was then  Now is now 
Today  in 2015  despite the Wall Street crash of 2008  which drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Depression  the American people are clearly better off economically than we were in 1937 
But  here is a very hard truth that we must acknowledge and address  Despite a huge increase in technology and productivity  despite major growth in the U S  and global economy  tens of millions of American families continue to lack the basic necessities of life  while millions more struggle every day to provide a minimal standard of living for their families  The reality is that for the last 40 years the great middle class of this country has been in decline and faith in our political system is now extremely low 
The rich get much richer  Almost everyone else gets poorer  Super PACs funded by billionaires buy elections  Ordinary people don't vote  We have an economic and political crisis in this country and the same old  same old establishment politics and economics will not effectively address it 
If we are serious about transforming our country  if we are serious about rebuilding the middle class  if we are serious about reinvigorating our democracy  we need to develop a political movement which  once again  is prepared to take on and defeat a ruling class whose greed is destroying our nation  The billionaire class cannot have it all  Our government belongs to all of us  and not just the one percent 
We need to create a culture which  as Pope Francis reminds us  cannot just be based on the worship of money  We must not accept a nation in which billionaires compete as to the size of their super-yachts  while children in America go hungry and veterans sleep out on the streets 
Today  in America  we are the wealthiest nation in the history of the world  but few Americans know that because so much of the new income and wealth goes to the people on top  In fact  over the last 30 years  there has been a massive transfer of wealth'trillions of wealth'going from the middle class to the top one-tenth of 1 percent'a handful of people who have seen a doubling of the percentage of the wealth they own over that period 
Unbelievably  and grotesquely  the top one-tenth of 1 percent owns nearly as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent 
Today  in America  millions of our people are working two or three jobs just to survive  In fact  Americans work longer hours than do the people of any industrialized country  Despite the incredibly hard work and long hours of the American middle class  58 percent of all new income generated today is going to the top one percent 
Today  in America  as the middle class continues to disappear  median family income  is $4 100 less than it was in 1999  The median male worker made over $700 less than he did 42 years ago  after adjusting for inflation  Last year  the median female worker earned more than $1 000 less than she did in 2007 
Today  in America  the wealthiest country in the history of the world  more than half of older workers have no retirement savings'zero'while millions of elderly and people with disabilities are trying to survive on $12 000 or $13 000 a year  From Vermont to California  older workers are scared to death   How will I retire with dignity , they ask 
Today  in America  nearly 47 million Americans are living in poverty and over 20 percent of our children  including 36 percent of African American children  are living in poverty'the highest rate of childhood poverty of nearly any major country on earth 
Today  in America  29 million Americans have no health insurance and even more are underinsured with outrageously high co-payments and deductibles  Further  with the United States paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs  1 out of 5 patients cannot afford to fill the prescriptions their doctors write 
Today  in America  youth unemployment and underemployment is over 35 percent  Meanwhile  we have more people in jail than any other country and countless lives are being destroyed as we spend $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans 
The bottom line is that today in America we not only have massive wealth and income inequality  but a power structure which protects that inequality  A handful of super-wealthy campaign contributors have enormous influence over the political process  while their lobbyists determine much of what goes on in Congress 
In 1944  in his State of the Union speech  President Roosevelt outlined what he called a second Bill of Rights  This is one of the most important speeches ever made by a president but  unfortunately  it has not gotten the attention that it deserves 
In that remarkable speech this is what Roosevelt stated  and I quote   We have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence  Necessitous men are not free men  End of quote  In other words  real freedom must include economic security  That was Roosevelt's vision 70 years ago  It is my vision today  It is a vision that we have not yet achieved  It is time that we did 
In that speech  Roosevelt described the economic rights that he believed every American was entitled to  The right to a decent job at decent pay  the right to adequate food  clothing  and time off from work  the right for every business  large and small  to function in an atmosphere free from unfair competition and domination by monopolies  The right of all Americans to have a decent home and decent health care 
What Roosevelt was stating in 1944  what Martin Luther King  Jr  stated in similar terms 20 years later and what I believe today  is that true freedom does not occur without economic security 
People are not truly free when they are unable to feed their family  People are not truly free when they are unable to retire with dignity  People are not truly free when they are unemployed or underpaid or when they are exhausted by working long hours  People are not truly free when they have no health care 
So let me define for you  simply and straightforwardly  what democratic socialism means to me  It builds on what Franklin Delano Roosevelt said when he fought for guaranteed economic rights for all Americans  And it builds on what Martin Luther King  Jr  said in 1968 when he stated that;  This country has socialism for the rich  and rugged individualism for the poor  It builds on the success of many other countries around the world that have done a far better job than we have in protecting the needs of their working families  the elderly  the children  the sick and the poor 
Democratic socialism means that we must create an economy that works for all  not just the very wealthy 
Democratic socialism means that we must reform a political system in America today which is not only grossly unfair but  in many respects  corrupt 
It is a system  for example  which during the 1990s allowed Wall Street to spend $5 billion in lobbying and campaign contributions to get deregulated  Then  ten years later  after the greed  recklessness  and illegal behavior of Wall Street led to their collapse  it is a system which provided trillions in government aid to bail them out  Wall Street used their wealth and power to get Congress to do their bidding for deregulation and then  when their greed caused their collapse  they used their wealth and power to get Congress to bail them out  Quite a system!
And  then  to add insult to injury  we were told that not only were the banks too big to fail  the bankers were too big to jail  Kids who get caught possessing marijuana get police records  Wall Street CEOs who help destroy the economy get raises in their salaries  This is what Martin Luther King  Jr  meant by socialism for the rich and rugged individualism for everyone else 
In my view  it's time we had democratic socialism for working families  not just Wall Street  billionaires and large corporations  It means that we should not be providing welfare for corporations  huge tax breaks for the very rich  or trade policies which boost corporate profits as workers lose their jobs  It means that we create a government that works for works for all of us  not just powerful special interests  It means that economic rights must be an essential part of what America stands for 
It means that health care should be a right of all people  not a privilege  This is not a radical idea  It exists in every other major country on earth  Not just Denmark  Sweden or Finland  It exists in Canada  France  Germany and Taiwan  That is why I believe in a Medicare-for-all single payer health care system  Yes  The Affordable Care Act  which I helped write and voted for  is a step forward for this country  But we must build on it and go further 
Medicare for all would not only guarantee health care for all people  not only save middle class families and our entire nation significant sums of money  it would radically improve the lives of all Americans and bring about significant improvements in our economy 
People who get sick will not have to worry about paying a deductible or making a co-payment  They could go to the doctor when they should  and not end up in the emergency room  Business owners will not have to spend enormous amounts of time worrying about how they are going to provide health care for their employees  Workers will not have to be trapped in jobs they do not like simply because their employers are offering them decent health insurance plans  Instead  they will be able to pursue the jobs and work they love  which could be an enormous boon for the economy  And by the way  moving to a Medicare for all program will end the disgrace of Americans paying  by far  the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs 
Democratic socialism means that  in the year 2015  a college degree is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50 years ago'and that public education must allow every person in this country  who has the ability  the qualifications and the desire  the right to go to a public colleges or university tuition free  This is also not a radical idea  It exists today in many countries around the world  In fact  it used to exist in the United States 
Democratic socialism means that our government does everything it can to create a full employment economy  It makes far more sense to put millions of people back to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure  than to have a real unemployment rate of almost 10 percent  It is far smarter to invest in jobs and educational opportunities for unemployed young people  than to lock them up and spend $80 billion a year through mass incarceration 
Democratic socialism means that if someone works forty hours a week  that person should not be living in poverty  that we must raise the minimum wage to a living wage�$15 an hour over the next few years  It means that we join the rest of the world and pass the very strong Paid Family and Medical Leave legislation now in Congress  How can it possibly be that the United States  today  is virtually the only nation on earth  large or small  which does not guarantee that a working class woman can stay home for a reasonable period of time with her new-born baby  How absurd is that 
Democratic socialism means that we have government policy which does not allow the greed and profiteering of the fossil fuel industry to destroy our environment and our planet  and that we have a moral responsibility to combat climate change and leave this planet healthy and inhabitable for our kids and grandchildren 
Democratic socialism means  that in a democratic  civilized society the wealthiest people and the largest corporations must pay their fair share of taxes  Yes  Innovation  entrepreneurship and business success should be rewarded  But greed for the sake of greed is not something that public policy should support  It is not acceptable that in a rigged economy in the last two years the wealthiest 15 Americans saw their wealth increase by $170 billion  more wealth than is owned by the bottom 130 million Americans  Let us not forget what Pope Francis has so elegantly stated;  We have created new idols  The worship of the golden calf of old has found a new and heartless image in the cult of money and the dictatorship of an economy which is faceless and lacking any truly humane goal  It is not acceptable that major corporations stash their profits in the Cayman Islands and other offshore tax havens to avoid paying $100 billion in taxes each and every year  It is not acceptable that hedge fund managers pay a lower effective tax rate than nurses or truck drivers  It is not acceptable that billionaire families are able to leave virtually all of their wealth to their families without paying a reasonable estate tax  It is not acceptable that Wall Street speculators are able to gamble trillions of dollars in the derivatives market without paying a nickel in taxes on those transactions 
Democratic socialism  to me  does not just mean that we must create a nation of economic and social justice  It also means that we must create a vibrant democracy based on the principle of one person one vote  It is extremely sad that the United States  one of the oldest democracies on earth  has one of the lowest voter turnouts of any major country  and that millions of young and working class people have given up on our political system entirely  Every American should be embarrassed that in our last national election 63% of the American people  and 80% of young people  did not vote  Clearly  despite the efforts of many Republican governors to suppress the vote  we must make it easier for people to participate in the political process  not harder  It is not too much to demand that everyone 18 years of age is registered to vote  end of discussion 
Further  it is unacceptable that we have a corrupt campaign finance system which allows millionaires  billionaires and large corporations to contribute as much as they want to Super Pacs to elect candidates who will represent their special interests  We must overturn Citizens United and move to public funding of elections 
So the next time you hear me attacked as a socialist  remember this 
I don't believe government should own the means of production  but I do believe that the middle class and the working families who produce the wealth of America deserve a fair deal 
I believe in private companies that thrive and invest and grow in America instead of shipping jobs and profits overseas 
I believe that most Americans can pay lower taxes'if hedge fund managers who make billions manipulating the marketplace finally pay the taxes they should 
I don't believe in special treatment for the top 1 percent  but I do believe in equal treatment for African-Americans who are right to proclaim the moral principle that Black Lives Matter 
I despise appeals to nativism and prejudice  and I do believe in immigration reform that gives Hispanics and others a pathway to citizenship and a better life 
I don't believe in some foreign  ism�, but I believe deeply in American idealism 
I'm not running for president because it's my turn  but because it's the turn of all of us to live in a nation of hope and opportunity not for some  not for the few  but for all 
No one understood better than FDR the connection between American strength at home and our ability to defend America at home and across the world  That is why he proposed a second Bill of Rights in 1944  and said in that State of the Union 
 America's own rightful place in the world depends in large part upon how fully these and similar rights have been carried into practice for all our citizens  For unless there is security here at home there cannot be lasting peace in the world  I'm not running to pursue reckless adventures abroad  but to rebuild America's strength at home  I will never hesitate to defend this nation  but I will never send our sons and daughters to war under false pretense or pretenses or into dubious battles with no end in sight 
And when we discuss foreign policy  let me join the people of Paris in mourning their loss  and pray that those who have been wounded will enjoy a full recovery  Our hearts also go out to the families of the hundreds of Russians apparently killed by an ISIS bomb on their flight  and those who lost their lives to terrorist attacks in Lebanon and elsewhere 
To my mind  it is clear that the United States must pursue policies to destroy the brutal and barbaric ISIS regime  and to create conditions that prevent fanatical extremist ideologies from flourishing  But we cannot'and should not'do it alone 
Our response must begin with an understanding of past mistakes and missteps in our previous approaches to foreign policy  It begins with the acknowledgment that unilateral military action should be a last resort  not a first resort  and that ill-conceived military decisions  such as the invasion of Iraq  can wreak far-reaching devastation and destabilize entire regions for decades  It begins with the reflection that the failed policy decisions of the past'rushing to war  regime change in Iraq  or toppling Mossadegh in Iran in 1953  or Guatemalan President  rbenz in 1954  Brazilian President Goulart in 1964  Chilean President Allende in 1973  These are the sorts of policies do not work  do not make us safer  and must not be repeated 
After World War II  in response to the fear of Soviet aggression  European nations and the United States established the North Atlantic Treaty Organization'an organization based on shared interests and goals and the notion of a collective defense against a common enemy  It is my belief that we must expand on these ideals and solidify our commitments to work together to combat the global threat of terror 
We must create an organization like NATO to confront the security threats of the 21st century'an organization that emphasizes cooperation and collaboration to defeat the rise of violent extremism and importantly to address the root causes underlying these brutal acts  We must work with our NATO partners  and expand our coalition to include Russia and members of the Arab League 
But let's be very clear  While the U S  and other western nations have the strength of our militaries and political systems  the fight against ISIS is a struggle for the soul of Islam  and countering violent extremism and destroying ISIS must be done primarily by Muslim nations'with the strong support of their global partners 
These same sentiments have been echoed by those in the region  Jordan's King Abdallah II said in a speech on Sunday that terrorism is the  greatest threat to our region and that Muslims must lead the fight against it  He noted that confronting extremism is both a regional and international responsibility  and that it is incumbent on Muslim nations and communities to confront those who seek to hijack their societies and generations with intolerance and violent ideology 
And let me congratulate King Abdallah not only for his wise remarks  but also for the role that his small country is playing in attempting to address the horrific refugee crisis in the region 
A new and strong coalition of Western powers  Muslim nations  and countries like Russia must come together in a strongly coordinated way to combat ISIS  to seal the borders that fighters are currently flowing across  to share counter-terrorism intelligence  to turn off the spigot of terrorist financing  and to end support for exporting radical ideologies 
What does all of this mean  Well  it means that  in many cases  we must ask more from those in the region  While Jordan  Turkey  Egypt  and Lebanon have accepted their responsibilities for taking in Syrian refugees  other countries in the region have done nothing or very little 
Equally important  and this is a point that must be made'countries in the region like Saudi Arabia  Kuwait  Qatar  UAE'countries of enormous wealth and resources'have contributed far too little in the fight against ISIS  That must change  King Abdallah is absolutely right when he says that that the Muslim nations must lead the fight against ISIS  and that includes some of the most wealthy and powerful nations in the region  who  up to this point have done far too little 
Saudi Arabia has the 3rd largest defense budget in the world  yet instead of fighting ISIS they have focused more on a campaign to oust Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen  Kuwait  a country whose ruling family was restored to power by U S  troops after the first Gulf War  has been a well-known source of financing for ISIS and other violent extremists  It has been reported that Qatar will spend $200 billion on the 2022 World Cup  including the construction of an enormous number of facilities to host that event�$200 billion on hosting a soccer event  yet very little to fight against ISIS  Worse still  it has been widely reported that the government has not been vigilant in stemming the flow of terrorist financing  and that Qatari individuals and organizations funnel money to some of the most extreme terrorist groups  including al Nusra and ISIS 
All of this has got to change  Wealthy and powerful Muslim nations in the region can no longer sit on the sidelines and expect the United States to do their work for them  As we develop a strongly coordinated effort  we need a commitment from these countries that the fight against ISIS takes precedence over the religious and ideological differences that hamper the kind of cooperation that we desperately need 
Further  we all understand that Bashar al-Assad is a brutal dictator who has slaughtered many of his own people  I am pleased that we saw last weekend diplomats from all over world  known as the International Syria Support Group  set a timetable for a Syrian-led political transition with open and fair elections  These are the promising beginnings of a collective effort to end the bloodshed and to move to political transition 
The diplomatic plan for Assad's transition from power is a good step in a united front  But our priority must be to defeat ISIS  Nations all over the world  who share a common interest in protecting themselves against international terrorist  must make the destruction of ISIS the highest priority  Nations in the region must commit  that instead of turning a blind eye  they will commit their resources to preventing the free flow of terrorist finances and fighters to Syria and Iraq  We need a commitment that they will counter the violent rhetoric that fuels terrorism  rhetoric that often occurs within their very borders 
This is the model in which we must pursue solutions to the sorts of global threats we face 
While individual nations indeed have historic disputes'the U S  and Russia  Iran and Saudi Arabia'the time is now to put aside those differences to work towards a common purpose of destroying ISIS  Sadly  as we have seen recently  no country is immune from attacks by the violent organization or those whom they have radicalized 
Thus  we must work with our partners in Europe  the Gulf states  Africa  and Southeast Asia'all along the way asking the hard questions whether their actions are serving our unified purpose 
The bottom line is that ISIS must be destroyed  but it cannot be defeated by the United States alone  A new and effective coalition must be formed with the Muslim nations leading the effort on the ground  while the United States and other major forces provide the support they need 
Election days come and go  But political and social revolutions that attempt to transform our society never end  They continue every day  every week and every month in the fight to create a nation of social and economic justice  That's what the trade union movement is about  That's what the civil rights movement is about  That's what the women's movement is about  That's what the gay rights movement is about  That's what the environmental movement is about hu
And that's what this campaign has been about over the past year  That's what the political revolution is about and that's why the political revolution must continue into the future 
Real change never takes place from the top down  or in the living rooms of wealthy campaign contributors  It always occurs from the bottom on up  when tens of millions of people say  enough is enough and become engaged in the fight for justice  That's what the political revolution we helped start is all about  That's why the political revolution must continue 
When we began this campaign a little over a year ago  we had no political organization  no money and very little name recognition  The media determined that we were a fringe campaign  Nobody thought we were going anywhere 
Well  a lot has changed over a year 
During this campaign  we won more than 12 million votes  We won 22 state primaries and caucuses  We came very close  within 2 points or less  in five more states 
In other words  our vision for the future of this country is not some kind of fringe idea  It is not a radical idea  It is mainstream  It is what millions of Americans believe in and want to see happen 
And something else extraordinarily important happened in this campaign that makes me very optimistic about the future of our country  something that  frankly  I had not anticipated  In virtually every state that we contested we won the overwhelming majority of the votes of people 45 years of age or younger  sometimes  may I say  by huge numbers  These are the people who are determined to shape the future of this country  These are the people who ARE the future of this country 
Together  in this campaign  1 5 million people came out to our rallies and town meetings in almost every state in the country 
Together  hundreds of thousands of volunteers made 75 million phone calls urging their fellow citizens into action 
Together  our canvassers knocked on more than 5 million doors 
Together  we hosted 74 000 meetings in every state and territory in this country 
Together  2 7 million people made over 8 million individual contributions to our campaign  more contributions at this point than any campaign in American history  Amazingly  the bulk of those contributions came from low-income and working people whose donations averaged $27 apiece  In an unprecedented way  we showed the world that we could run a strong national campaign without being dependent on the big-money interests whose greed has done so much to damage our country 
And let me give a special thanks to the financial support we received from students struggling to repay their college loans  from seniors and disabled vets on Social Security  from workers earning starvation wages and even from people who were unemployed 
In every single state that we contested we took on virtually the entire political establishment  U S  senators  members of Congress  governors  mayors  state legislators and local party leaders  To those relatively few elected officials who had the courage to stand with us  I say thank you  We must continue working together into the future 
This campaign has never been about any single candidate  It is always about transforming America 
It is about ending a campaign finance system which is corrupt and allows billionaires to buy elections 
It is about ending the grotesque level of wealth and income inequality that we are experiencing where almost all new wealth and income goes to the people on top  where the 20 wealthiest people own more wealth than the bottom 150 million 
It is about creating an economy that works for all of us  not just the 1 percent 
It is about ending the disgrace of native Americans who live on the Pine Ridge  South Dakota  reservation having a life expectancy lower than many third-world countries 
It is about ending the incredible despair that exists in many parts of this country where  as a result of unemployment and low wages  suicide  drugs and alcohol  millions of Americans are now dying  in an ahistorical way  at a younger age than their parents 
It is about ending the disgrace of having the highest level of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth and having public school systems in inner cities that are totally failing our children  where kids now stand a greater chance of ending up in jail than ending up with a college degree 
It is about ending the disgrace that millions of undocumented people in this country continue to live in fear and are exploited every day on their jobs because they have no legal rights 
It is about ending the disgrace of tens of thousands of Americans dying every year from preventable deaths because they either lack health insurance  have high deductibles or cannot afford the outrageously high cost of the prescription drugs they need 
It is about ending the disgrace of hundreds of thousands of bright young people unable to go to college because their families are poor or working class  while millions more struggle with suffocating levels of student debt 
It is about ending the pain of a young single mother in Nevada  in tears  telling me that she doesn't know how she and her daughter can make it on $10 45 an hour  And the reality that today millions of our fellow Americans are working at starvation wages 
It is about ending the disgrace of a mother in Flint  Michigan  telling me what has happened to the intellectual development of her child as a result of lead in the water in that city  of many thousands of homes in California and other communities unable to drink the polluted water that comes out of their faucets 
In America  In the year 2016  In a nation whose infrastructure is crumbling before our eyes 
It is about ending the disgrace that too many veterans still sleep out on the streets  that homelessness is increasing and that tens of millions of Americans  because of a lack of affordable housing  are paying 40  50 percent or more of their limited incomes to put a roof over their heads 
It is about ending the disgrace that  in a given year  corporations making billions in profit avoid paying a nickel in taxes because they stash their money in the Cayman Islands and other tax havens 
This campaign is about defeating Donald Trump  the Republican candidate for president  After centuries of racism  sexism and discrimination of all forms in our country we do not need a major party candidate who makes bigotry the cornerstone of his campaign  We cannot have a president who insults Mexicans and Latinos  Muslims  women and African-Americans  We cannot have a president who  in the midst of so much income and wealth inequality  wants to give hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the very rich  We cannot have a president who  despite all of the scientific evidence  believes that climate change is a hoax 
The major political task that we face in the next five months is to make certain that Donald Trump is defeated and defeated badly  And I personally intend to begin my role in that process in a very short period of time 
But defeating Donald Trump cannot be our only goal  We must continue our grassroots efforts to create the America that we know we can become  And we must take that energy into the Democratic National Convention on July 25 in Philadelphia where we will have more than 1 900 delegates 
I recently had the opportunity to meet with Secretary Clinton and discuss some of the very important issues facing our country and the Democratic Party  It is no secret that Secretary Clinton and I have strong disagreements on some very important issues  It is also true that our views are quite close on others  I look forward  in the coming weeks  to continued discussions between the two campaigns to make certain that your voices are heard and that the Democratic Party passes the most progressive platform in its history and that Democrats actually fight for that agenda  I also look forward to working with Secretary Clinton to transform the Democratic Party so that it becomes a party of working people and young people  and not just wealthy campaign contributors  a party that has the courage to take on Wall Street  the pharmaceutical industry  the fossil fuel industry and the other powerful special interests that dominate our political and economic life 
As I have said throughout this campaign  the Democratic Party must support raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour  and create millions of jobs rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure 
We must ensure that women will no longer make 79-cents on the dollar compared to men and that we fight for pay equity 
We must fight to make certain that women throughout the country have the right to control their own bodies 
We must protect the right of our gay brothers and sisters to marriage equality in every state America 
As the recent tragedy in Orlando has made crystal clear  we must ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons  end the gun show loophole and expand instant background checks 
We must defeat the Trans-Pacific Partnership and make certain that that bad trade deal does not get a vote in a lame-duck session of Congress 
We must resist all efforts to cut Social Security and  in fact  expand benefits for our seniors and disabled veterans 
We must understand that the greed  recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street has to end  that we need to pass modern-day Glass-Steagall legislation and that we need to break up the biggest financial institutions in this country who not only remain too big to fail but who prevent the kind of vigorous competition that a healthy financial system requires 
We must aggressively combat climate change and transform our energy system  move to energy efficiency and sustainable energy and impose a tax on carbon  It means that  in order to protect our water supply  we ban fracking 
We must compete effectively in a global economy by making public colleges and universities tuition free and substantially reduce student debt 
We must join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all people as a right and not a privilege 
We must end the disgrace of having more people in jail than any other country on earth and move toward real criminal justice reform at the federal  state and local levels 
We must pass comprehensive immigration reform and provide a path toward citizenship for 11 million undocumented people 
We must take a hard look at the waste  cost overruns and inefficiencies in every branch of government  including the Department of Defense  And we must make certain our brave young men and women in the military are not thrown into perpetual warfare in the Middle East or other wars we should not be fighting 
But the political revolution means much more than fighting for our ideals at the Democratic National Convention and defeating Donald Trump 
It means that  at every level  we continue the fight to make our society a nation of economic  social  racial and environmental justice 
It means that we can no longer ignore the fact that  sadly  the current Democratic Party leadership has turned its back on dozens of states in this country and has allowed right-wing politicians to win elections in some states with virtually no opposition  including some of the poorest states in America  The Democratic Party needs a 50-state strategy  We may not win in every state tomorrow but we will never win unless we recruit good candidates and develop organizations that can compete effectively in the future  We must provide resources to those states which have so long been ignored 
Most importantly  the Democratic Party needs leadership which is prepared to open its doors and welcome into its ranks working people and young people  That is the energy that we need to transform the Democratic Party  take on the special interests and transform our country 
Here is a cold  hard fact that must be addressed  Since 2009  some 900 legislative seats have been lost to Republicans in state after state throughout this country  In fact  the Republican Party now controls 31 state legislatures and controls both the governors mansions and statehouses in 23 states  That is unacceptable 
We need to start engaging at the local and state level in an unprecedented way  Hundreds of thousands of volunteers helped us make political history during the last year  These are people deeply concerned about the future of our country and their own communities  Now we need many of them to start running for school boards  city councils  county commissions  state legislatures and governorships  State and local governments make enormously important decisions and we cannot allow right-wing Republicans to increasingly control them 
I hope very much that many of you listening tonight are prepared to engage at that level  Please go to my website at berniesanders com/win to learn more about how you can effectively run for office or get involved in politics at the local or state level  I have no doubt that with the energy and enthusiasm our campaign has shown that we can win significant numbers of local and state elections if people are prepared to become involved  I also hope people will give serious thought to running for statewide offices and the U S  Congress 
And when we talk about transforming America  it is not just about elections  Many of my Republican colleagues believe that government is the enemy  that we need to eviscerate and privatize virtually all aspects of government  whether it is Social Security  Medicare  the VA  EPA  the Postal Service or public education  I strongly disagree  In a democratic civilized society  government must play an enormously important role in protecting all of us and our planet  But in order for government to work efficiently and effectively  we need to attract great and dedicated people from all walks of life  We need people who are dedicated to public service and can provide the services we need in a high quality and efficient way 
When we talk about a Medicare-for-all health care program and the need to make sure all of our people have quality health care  it means that we need tens of thousands of new doctors  nurses  dentists  psychologists and other medical personnel who are prepared to practice in areas where people today lack access to that care 
It means that we need hundreds of thousands of people to become childcare workers and teachers so that our young people will get the best education available in the world 
It means that as we combat climate change and transform our energy system away from fossil fuels  we need scientists and engineers and entrepreneurs who will help us make energy efficiency  solar energy  wind energy  geothermal and other developing technologies as efficient and cost effective as possible 
It means that as we rebuild our crumbling infrastructure  we need millions of skilled construction workers of all kinds 
It means that when we talk about growing our economy and creating jobs  we need great business people who can produce and distribute the products and services we need in a way that respects their employees and the environment 
In other words  we need a new generation of people actively involved in public service who are prepared to provide the quality of life the American people deserve 
Shortly after the polls closed  Secretary Clinton called and was very gracious in her congratulations  I thank her for her call  and I congratulate her and her supporters for the vigorous campaign that they ran in New Hampshire 
And  let me take this opportunity to thank the many  many thousands of volunteers here in the granite state who worked so tirelessly  Our volunteers worked night and day  made phone calls  and knocked on a heck of a lot of doors  and we won because of your energy  Thank you all so much 
I want to thank Julia Bond and our great campaign staff  We have sent a message that will echo from Wall Street to Washington  from Maine to California  and that is that the government of our great country belongs to all of the people and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors  and their Super PACs 
Nine months ago we began our campaign here in New Hampshire  We had no campaign organization  we had no money  and we were taking on the most powerful political organization in the United States of America  Tonight  with what appears to be a record breaking voter turnout  because of a huge voter turnout -- and I say huge  we won  Because we harnessed the energy  and the excitement that the Democratic party will need to succeed in November 
What happened here in New Hampshire in terms of an enthusiastic  and aroused electorate  people who came out in large numbers  That is what will happen all over this country  Let us never forget  Democrats and progressives win when voter turnout is high  Republicans win when people are demoralized  and voter turnout is low 
Tonight  we served notice to the political and economic establishment of this country that the American people will not continue to accept a corrupt campaign finance system that is undermining American democracy  and we will not accept a rigged economy in which ordinary Americans work longer hours for lower wages  while almost all new income and wealth goes to the top 1%.
I want to take this opportunity again to congratulate Secretary Clinton and her organization and supporters for waging a vigorous campaign  I hope that in the days ahead we can continue to wage a strong  issue oriented campaign  and bring new people into the political process 
But  I also hope that we all remember -- and this is a message not just to our opponents  but to those who support me as well  That we will need to come together in a few months and unite this party  and this nation because the right-wing Republicans we oppose must not be allowed to gain the presidency 
As we all remember  the last time Republicans occupied the White House  their trickle down economic policies drove us into the worst economic downturn since the depression of the 1930's  No  we will not allow huge tax breaks for billionaires  we will not allow packed -- huge cuts to social security  veterans needs  Medicare  MedicAid  and education  No  we will not allow back into the White House a political party which is so beholden to the fossil fuel industry that they cannot even acknowledge the scientific reality of climate change (INAUDIBLE).
The people of New Hampshire have sent a profound message to the political establishment  to the economic establishment  and by the way  to the media establishment 
What the people here have said is given the enormous crises facing our country  it is just too late for the same old  same old establishment politics  and establishment economics  The people want real change  What the American people are saying -- and  by the way  I hear this not just from progressives  but from conservatives and from moderates  is that we can no longer continue to have a campaign finances system in which Wall Street and the billionaire class are able to buy elections 
Americans  no matter what their political view may be  understand that that is not what democracy is about  That is what oligarchy is about  and we will not allow that to continue  I do not have a Super PAC  and I do not want a Super PAC  I am overwhelmed  and I am deeply moved far more than I can express in words by the fact that our campaigns financial support comes from more than one million Americans who have made more than 3 7 million individual contributions  That is more individual contributions than any candidate in the history of the United States up until this point in an election 
And  you know what that average contribution was  $27 dollars 
I am going to New York City tonight and tomorrow  but I'm not going to New York City to hold a fundraiser on Wall Street  Instead  I'm going to hold a fundraiser right here  right now  across America  My request is please go to Berniesanders com and contribute  Please help us raise the funds we need  whether it's $10 bucks  $20 bucks  or $50 bucks  Help up us raise the money we need to take the fight to Nevada  South Carolina  and the states on Super Tuesday 
So  there it is  that's our fundraiser  Pretty quick 
Now  what the American people understand is that our great country was based on a simple principal  and that principle is fairness  Let me be very clear  it is not fair when we have more income and wealth inequality today than almost any major country on Earth  And  when the top one-tenth of 1% now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%, that's not fair  It is not fair when the 20 wealthiest people in this country now own more wealth than the bottom half of the American people 
So  are you guys ready for a radical idea  Together we are going to create an economy that works for all of us  not just the 1%. And  when millions of our people are working for starvation wages  yep  we're going to raise the minimum wage to $15 bucks an hour  And  we are going to bring pay equity for women  And  when we need the best educated workforce in the world  yes  we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition free  And  for the millions of Americans struggling with horrendous levels of student debt  we are going to substantially ease that burden 
In America people should be financially distressed for decades for the crime  the crime of trying to get a higher education  that's absurd 
Well  my critics say  you know  Bernie  that's a great idea  you're into all this free stuff  How are you going to pay for it  I will tell you how we're going to pay for it  We're going to impose a tax on Wall Street speculation  The greed  the recklessness  and the illegal behavior drove our economy to its knees  The American people bailed out Wall Street  now it's Wall Street's time to help the middle class 
And  when we talk about transforming America  it means ending the disgrace of this country having more people in jail than any other country in the world  disproportionately African-American  and Latino  Not only are we going to fight to end institutional racism  and a broken criminal justice system  we are going to provide jobs and education for our young people  not jails and incarceration 
And  Let me say that as a member of the energy committee in the Senate  and the environmental committee  the debate is over  Climate change is real  It is caused by human activity  and it is already causing devastating problems in this country and around the world  We have a moral responsibility to work with countries throughout the world to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy 
Now  I have been criticized during this campaign for many  many things  Every single day  that's OK  that's alright  They're throwing everything at me except the kitchen sink  and I have the feeling that kitchen sink is coming pretty soon as well  But  what our campaign is about is thinking big  not small  It's about having the courage to reject the status quo  It's about saying that in a time when every major country on Earth guarantees healthcare to all of their people  we should be doing the same in our great country 
In my view  under President Obama's leadership  the Affordable Care Act has been an important step forward  no question about it  But  we can  and must  do better  Twenty-nine million Americans should not remain uninsured  an even greater number should remain under- insured with large deductibles and co-payments  We should not be paying by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs at a time -- listen to this  when the top three drug companies in this country made $45 billion dollars in profit last year  That is an obscenity  and let me tell you something  When we make it to the White House  the pharmaceutical industry will not continue to rip-off the American people 
Further  it makes no sense that as a nation we continue to spend far  far more per capita than do the people of any other nation  all of whom guarantee healthcare to all of their people  That is why I believe in a Medicare for all  single-payer program which will not only guarantee healthcare for all  but will save the average middle class family thousands of dollars a year in health care costs 
My friends  we all know that we live in a dangerous and complex world  As president I will defend this nation  but I will do it responsibly  I voted against the war in Iraq  and that was the right vote  While we must be relentless in combating terrorist who would do us harm  we cannot  and should not be the policeman of the world  Nor should we bear the burden of fighting terrorism alone 
In the Middle East  the United States must remain part of an international coalition sustained by nations in the region that have the means to protect themselves  Together we must  and will  destroy ISIS  but we should do it in a way that does not put our young men and women in the military into perpetual warfare in the quagmire of the Middle East 
My friends  we must fix our broken immigration system that divides families  and create a path towards citizenship for hardworking people who are living in the shadows 
We must strengthen and expand Social Security  and increase the benefits that seniors  and disabled vets receive so that people can live in dignity in their retirement  We must rebuild our crumbling infrastructure  and when we do that  we create millions of decent paying jobs 
We must pursue the fight for women's rights  for gay rights  for disability rights  We must against stronger  and stronger  opposition protect the right of a woman to control her own body 
We must protect the men and women who serve our nation in uniform  and protect our veterans who put their lives on the line to defend us 
My friends  we must tell the billionaire class and the 1% that they cannot have it all at a time of massive wealth and income inequality  the wealthiest people and largest corporations in this country will start their paying their fair share of taxes 
My friends  I am the son of a Polish immigrant who came to this country speaking no English  and having no money  My father worked everyday of his life  and he never made a whole lot  My Mom and Dad  and brother and I grew up in a small three and a half room  rent controlled apartment in Brooklyn  New York  My Mother  who died at a young age  always dreamed of moving out of that apartment  getting a home of her own  but she never realized that dream 
The truth is that neither one of my parents could ever have dreamed that I would be here tonight standing before you as a candidate for President of the United States 
This is the promise of America  and this is the promise we must keep alive for future generations  What began last week in Iowa  what voters here in New Hampshire confirm tonight  is nothing short of the beginning of a political revolution 
It is a political revolution that will bring tens of millions of our people together  It will bring together working people who have given up on the political process  It will bring together young people who have never participated in the political process  It will bring together blacks  and whites  latinos  Asian-Americans  Native Americans  straight and gay  male and female  People who were born in America  and people who immigrated here 
We will all come together to say loudly  and clearly that the government of our great nation belongs to all of us  not just a few wealthy campaign contributors  That is what this campaign is about  that is what the political revolution is about  So  New Hampshire  thank you again  And  now it's time 
Thank you  New Hampshire  And  now it's on to Nevada  South Carolina  and beyond 

Let me conclude by once again thanking everyone who has helped in this campaign in one way or another  We have begun the long and arduous process of transforming America  a fight that will continue tomorrow  next week  next year and into the future 
My hope is that when future historians look back and describe how our country moved forward into reversing the drift toward oligarchy  and created a government which represents all the people and not just the few  they will note that  to a significant degree  that effort began with the political revolution of 2016 
Thank you very much  Good night
